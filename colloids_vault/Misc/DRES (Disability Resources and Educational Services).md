## Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Students requesting accommodations on the basis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) must provide documentation by a professional who has undergone comprehensive training and has relevant experience in differential diagnosis and the full range of psychiatric disorders (e.g., a licensed clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist, psychiatrist, or other relevantly trained specialist). The documentation must include:

- Evidence of early impairment — the condition must have been exhibited in childhood in more than one setting;

- Evidence of current impairment — a history of the individual’s attentional symptoms and evidence of current impulsive/hyperactive or inattentive behaviors that significantly impair functioning in two or more settings must be provided;

- A diagnostic interview — the interview must contain self-report and third-party information pertaining to developmental history, family history of ADHD or other learning or psychological difficulties, relevant medical and medication history, a thorough academic history, and a review of prior psychoeducational test reports to determine whether a pattern of strengths or weaknesses is supportive of attention or learning problems;

- Evidence of alternative diagnoses or explanations being ruled out — the documentation must investigate and discuss the possibility of dual diagnoses and alternative or coexisting mood, behavioral, neurological and/or personality disorders that may confound the ADHD diagnosis;

- Neuropsychological or psychoeducational assessments **as needed** to determine the current impact of the disorder on the individual’s ability to function in an academic setting — such data, if provided, should include subtest and standard scores;

- A specific psychological diagnosis as per the DSM-5-TR; and

- A clinical summary which:
    
    - Indicates the substantial limitations to major life activities posed by the disability;
    
    - Describes the extent to which these limitations would impact the academic context for which accommodations are being requested;
    
    - Suggests how the specific effects of the disability may be accommodated; and
    
    - States how the effects of ADHD are mediated by the recommended accommodations.
