# PART I: BASICS ABOUT SURFACES

1. Introduction
2. Distinctive features of interfaces  
    what is an interface? – how to describe an interface?  
    what are typical behavior patterns? real versus apparent area – surface to volume ratio -surface  
    energy – surface structure and composition versus that of the bulk.
3. Surface energy  [Weeks 1 - 4]
    typical values — how to measure it? — reconstruction, relaxation, molecular orientation, melting,  
    roughening — how to evaluate surface structure?
4. Surface thermodynamics  [Weeks 5 - 6]
    origin of surface energy — Gibbs dividing surface — surface excess functions  
    Gibbs adsorption equation — other implications
5. Adsorption isotherms  
    physisorption versus chemisorptions — adsorption isotherms: Langmuir, BET,  
    etc. — internal interfaces: critical micelle concentration
6. Monomolecular films  
    pressure-area diagrams — Langmuir-Blodgett films — self-assembled monolayers,  
    SAMs — layer-by-layer self-assembly
7. Curved surfaces  
    capillary pressure: the Young-Laplace equation — vapor pressure: the Kelvin equation —  
    implications: nanoparticles, adhesion, etc.
