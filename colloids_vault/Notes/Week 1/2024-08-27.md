# Refs
- Arthur W. Adamson and Alice P. Gast, Physical Chemistry of Surfaces, 6 edition,  
    Wiley, New York, 1997. A good reference book, but it’s hard to read an  
    encyclopedia.
- Gabor A. Somorjai, Introduction to Surface Chemistry and Catalysis, 2 Ed,  
    Wiley, New York, 2010. Clearly written, comprehensive.
- Andrew Zangwill, Physics at Surfaces, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,1988 This is the physics point of view (electronic structure, phase transitions,  
    epitaxy …) and complements the chemistry point of view in the book by Somorjai.
- The recommended textbook for the second half of the class is:  
    Jacob N. Israelachvili, Intermolecular and Surface Forces, 3rd ed., Academic Press, New  
    York, 2011.
