# 2.8 Measurement of Surface Tension



- Volume Fraction of an FCC unit cell (packing density)
- **Definition of surface tension:** Work needed to create surface is proportional to area of new surface $\Delta A$.
$$\begin{aligned}
& w=\gamma \cdot \Delta A \\
& w \equiv \text { work } \\
& \Delta A \equiv \text { change in area }
\end{aligned}$$

- Assume that the following forces are balanced (i.e. the plate is stationary)
	- $F_{buoyancy}$
	- $F_{gravity/weight}$
	- $F_{measure}$
	- $F_{surface} \sim \gamma \cdot (2w + 2d)\cdot cos(\theta)$ 

	- $F_{buoyancy} + F_{measured} = F_{weight} + F_{surface}$



$$
\begin{aligned}
& \underbrace{F_{\text {buoyancy }}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Ignor e plate is } \\
\text { small }
\end{array}}+F_{\text {measured }}=\underbrace{F_{\text {weight }}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Ignor p plate is } \\
\text { small }
\end{array}}+F_{\text {surface }} \\
& \Longrightarrow F_{\text {measured }}=F_{\text {surface }} \\
& \Longrightarrow F_{\text {measured }}=F^{\prime} \cdot \cos (\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$


$$
\begin{aligned}
& F^{\prime}=\gamma \cdot \text { Perimeter of Plate } \\
& =\gamma \cdot l \\
& =\gamma(2 w+2 d)
\end{aligned}
$$


$$
\Longrightarrow F_{\text {measured }}=\gamma \cdot l \cdot \cos (\theta)
$$


Often, it is assumed that $\theta=0$, and $l$ is made very large, which leads to less error.|



## Other Methods

- **Young Equation:** Droplet on surface: measure $\theta$, then calculate $\gamma$
- Capillary Rise
- Drop profiles
- spinning drop tensionmeters


# Liquid Mixtures


$\begin{array}{lll}\text { air-water } & 72 & \frac{mJ}{m^2} \\ \text { air-ethanol } & 23 & \frac{mJ}{m^2}\end{array}$


- **If we mix the liquids, how will the surface tension change?**
- Plot of surface tension against % ethanol
	- ethanol and water are miscible: ethanol segregates to surface because it has lower interfacial tension.

- adding a small amount of ethanol causes drastic drop in surface tension (==rev==)

# Characterization Methods for Surfaces

- AFM
- SEM
- TEM
- Confocal Microscopy
- spectroscopy
- scattering (x-ray, neutron, ...)

- Averaging techniques (scattering, spectroscopy)

- When you are examining your sample with the instrument, you need to
	- Make sure your instrument can separate the surface from the bulk (so that you know that the scattering is coming from the surface only).
	- **surface irregularities/consistency:** 
	- **buried interfaces:**


## Scattering Techniques


### X-ray Diffraction (XRD)

- most commonly used for bulk, ordered structures
- **penetration adsorption depth:** adsorption length of x-ray 10-100 $\mu m$. This is too large for most interfaces
	- To fix this, we can use smaller angles (glancing angle at $\theta \sim (0.5 - 2)$ degrees)
	- **grazing angle of incidence**

### Neutron Scattering

- x-rays interact with $e^{-}$
- **Advantage over x-rays:** Neutrons interact with nuclei and do not interact with electrons. Good for probing materials that do not have a lot of electrons (==rev==)
- **Disadvantage:** Very few sources in the world



## Low Energy Electron Diffraction

- $E \sim 20 - 200 eV$ which is very low

- Exponential Decay (==rev==)

- **Intensity:** $I(d)=I_0 e^{-d / L}$
	- $I_{0}$ is the incidence intensity
	- $L$ is the inelastic mean free path
- **Characteristic distance:** ($5-10 \AA$) an $e^{-}$ travels before intensity drops to $\frac {1}{e}$ of $I_{0}$
- Only a few atom thicknesses are sampled by low electron beam, which means that this is great for probing surfaces


### Ion Scattering

- Ions ($H^{+}$, ...) are large (==rev==)
	- don't penetrate
	- surface sensitivity


### Limitations of Scattering

- indirect
- averaged information (e.g. average orientation)
	- no real space information
- **insensitive to spatial variation:** You won't be able to see inhomogeneity in material
- neutron beam, etc, can potentially damage material



# 3.2 Microscopy Methods


## Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)

- How does it work? (==rev==)
- **Disadvantages:** 
	- Does not work for insulating materials
	- vibration control
	- fragile and expensive
	- sharp tip
	- stable, clean surfaces
- What is **tunneling current**?
- **Quantum tunneling:** probability based on electron states/orbitals

- **Advantages:**
