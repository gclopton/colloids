# Surface Roughness

Let's expand on the topic of **surface roughness** and its connection to surface energy, entropy, and temperature.

### Surface Roughness

#### 1. **Surfaces Cost Energy**
- Surfaces tend to **cost energy** because the atoms or molecules at the surface are in a higher-energy state compared to those in the bulk. This is because surface atoms are not fully surrounded by neighboring atoms, leading to fewer bonds and higher potential energy.
  
- As a result, materials will naturally try to **minimize their surface area** to reduce the amount of energy stored in the surface. This is why liquids, for example, form spherical droplets, as a sphere has the smallest surface area for a given volume.

#### 2. **Not All Surfaces Are Smooth**
- In practice, many real-world surfaces, such as **concrete**, **asphalt**, or even **biological surfaces**, are far from perfectly smooth. The reason for this roughness can be attributed to a balance between **entropy** and **energy**.

#### 3. **Entropy vs. Energy**
- **Energy minimization**: As mentioned earlier, systems prefer to minimize their energy, which would ideally lead to smooth surfaces.
  
- **Entropy**: However, **entropy** represents disorder in the system. In many cases, the system's disorder, driven by entropy, can counteract the tendency to minimize surface energy. Entropy generally favors a higher degree of disorder, leading to irregular, **rough surfaces** rather than perfectly smooth ones.
  
  - **Entropy and surface roughness**: Surface roughness can be thought of as the result of the system not reaching a perfectly ordered (low-energy) state. The system might be stuck in a **metastable state**—one that is not perfectly smooth but stable enough, given the influence of entropy.

#### 4. **Time and Kinetics**
- Surfaces may also be **rough** because the system **does not have enough time** to reach the most energetically favorable state (which would be a smoother surface).
  
  - In some cases, such as rapidly cooled materials, the system gets "trapped" in a rough configuration because it **cannot relax** to the lowest-energy configuration quickly enough. This leads to surfaces that remain rough, especially if the energy barrier to smoothing the surface is too high to be overcome within the timescale of the process.

#### 5. **Temperature's Role**
- **Temperature** also plays a key role in the competition between energy minimization and entropy. Temperature increases molecular motion, which contributes to **entropy** and allows atoms and molecules to explore more configurations.
  
  - **Higher temperatures**: As the temperature increases, **thermal energy** can increase surface roughness by enhancing the movement of atoms and molecules. Higher temperatures give the system more thermal energy, making it harder for the system to settle into a perfectly smooth, low-energy state.
  
  - **Lower temperatures**: At lower temperatures, the system has less thermal energy, so it is more likely to settle into configurations that minimize surface area, leading to **smoother surfaces**.

#### 6. **Balance of Forces**
- The ultimate shape and roughness of a surface are determined by the **balance between energy minimization, entropy, and temperature**. In some cases, energy minimization dominates, and the surface becomes smooth. In other cases, entropy and temperature dominate, leading to rough or disordered surfaces.

### Summary
- Surfaces cost energy, and systems naturally try to minimize surface area.
- However, **entropy** (disorder) counteracts this tendency, and in many cases, surfaces are rough rather than smooth.
- Systems might not have enough **time** to reach the lowest-energy configuration, leading to surface roughness.
- **Temperature** also plays a role, with higher temperatures promoting rougher surfaces due to increased thermal motion and entropy.

In real-world systems, it's the **balance between energy minimization, entropy, and temperature** that determines whether a surface is smooth or rough.

# Surface Entropy

![[Pasted image 20241022161830.png|500]]


The figure you provided illustrates the competition between **energy minimization** and **entropy** in determining the structure of surfaces, particularly the roughness or flatness of a surface.

### Key Concepts in the Figure:

1. **Energy Favors Flat Surfaces (Top Diagram):**
   - In the top part of the image, it shows a flat, ordered surface where the atoms are arranged in a regular, predictable pattern.
   - **Energy minimization** tends to favor a **flat, smooth surface** because this reduces the surface energy. The more ordered and tightly packed the atoms, the fewer unsatisfied bonds there are, resulting in a lower-energy configuration.
   - The symbol \( \Omega = 1 \) is likely referring to a low **multiplicity** (number of possible configurations or states), indicating that this configuration is highly ordered with minimal entropy.

2. **Entropy Favors Rough Surfaces (Bottom Diagram):**
   - The bottom part of the image shows a **rough surface**, where the atoms are more disordered, and there is noticeable irregularity in the surface height.
   - **Entropy**, which represents the degree of disorder in a system, favors this kind of **rough, irregular surface** because it allows for a larger number of possible configurations. A rough surface increases the disorder of the system, which is energetically favorable from an entropic standpoint, particularly at higher temperatures.
   - The symbol \( \Omega > 1 \) represents a higher multiplicity, meaning there are more possible configurations, which corresponds to a higher entropy.

### The Tradeoff:
- **Energy vs. Entropy:**  
  The system's surface configuration depends on the balance between energy minimization (which favors smooth surfaces) and entropy (which favors rough surfaces). At low temperatures, energy minimization usually dominates, leading to smoother surfaces. At higher temperatures, entropy becomes more significant, which can result in rougher surfaces.

### Summary:
This figure is conveying that while **energy** drives the system to form smooth, ordered surfaces, **entropy** promotes rough, disordered surfaces. The roughness of a surface is a consequence of the competition between these two forces, with higher entropy states being favored as the number of possible surface configurations (represented by \( \Omega \)) increases.


Entropy + Energy = Free Energy
In thermodynamics, the competition between energy and entropy is encapsulated in the concept of free energy. Free energy is the quantity that tells us what the system will actually do because it balances both the energy and entropy contributions.
1. Free Energy Expression:

The most common form of free energy used in many systems is the Gibbs free energy (G), which is defined as:

$$
G=H-T S
$$

where:
- $G=$ Gibbs free energy (the energy available to do work),
- $H=$ Enthalpy (a measure of the total energy, including internal energy and the energy required to make space for the system, i.e., pressure-volume work),
- $T=$ Temperature (in Kelvin),
- $S=$ Entropy (the measure of disorder or randomness in the system).

In this equation:
- The enthalpy term (H) accounts for the energy of the system, including bond energy and internal forces.
- The entropy term (-TS) accounts for the disorder or randomness in the system, and how much of the energy is "unavailable" for doing work due to the system's entropy.

2. Balancing Energy and Entropy:
- Energy minimization: The system tends to minimize its internal energy (favoring more stable, lower-energy configurations).
- Entropy maximization: At the same time, the system tends to maximize its entropy (favoring more disordered states).

Free energy combines both: By minimizing the free energy (G), the system finds a balance between these two competing tendencies: reducing energy while maximizing entropy.


3. Laboratory Measurables:
- Free energy is important because its derivatives with respect to measurable quantities like temperature, pressure, and chemical potential give information that can be measured directly in the lab. This is why free energy is so useful in practice-it connects thermodynamics with measurable physical properties.

Examples of derivatives of free energy include:
- Chemical potential $(\mu)$ :

$$
\mu=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N}\right)_{T, P}
$$

where $N$ is the number of particles (or moles). The chemical potential tells us how much the free energy changes when the number of particles changes.
- Pressure:

Pressure can be derived from the free energy in processes involving volume changes.
- Temperature:

The relationship between free energy and entropy becomes clearer through temperature dependence (since entropy is multiplied by temperature in the free energy equation).


4. Minimizing Free Energy to Determine System Behavior:
- The goal of a system is to minimize its free energy. This minimization dictates what the system will do under certain conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure).
- Low temperature: At lower temperatures, the entropy term $(-T S)$ is smaller, so the system tends to be dominated by energy minimization, leading to more ordered, lowerenergy states (such as crystals or smooth surfaces).
- High temperature: At higher temperatures, the entropy term becomes larger, and the system may tolerate higher energy configurations to increase entropy, leading to more disorder or rougher surfaces.

This means that the minimization of free energy takes both the energy and entropy components into account, balancing the two to predict what the system will actually do under given conditions.

# Entropy


Entropy Formula:
- Entropy ( $\mathbf{S}$ ) is a measure of the number of possible microstates that correspond to a particular macrostate. A macrostate is an observable state of the system (e.g., how many particles are in each half of a box), and a microstate is a specific arrangement of particles that results in that macrostate.

The formula for entropy is:

$$
S=k \cdot \ln (\Omega)
$$

where:
- $S=$ Entropy,
- $k=$ Boltzmann constant $\left(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{K}\right)$,
- $\Omega=$ Multiplicity (the number of microstates that correspond to a given macrostate),
- $\ln =$ Natural logarithm.

This formula quantifies how disordered a system is by counting how many different ways (microstates) the system can be arranged while still appearing in the same overall macrostate.


Example: Ideal Gas in a Box
What is an Ideal Gas?
- An ideal gas is a gas where the particles do not interact with one another. There are no intermolecular forces (such as attraction or repulsion) between the gas molecules. The particles move randomly and independently of one another.
- In an ideal gas, we are primarily concerned with entropy, not energy, because the interactions between the particles are neglected. The particles are assumed to behave like perfectly elastic objects that only transfer momentum during collisions with the walls of the container.

Dividing the System into Two Compartments:
- Let's consider a system with two gas particles in a box. If we divide the box into two compartments, we are interested in predicting how the particles will distribute themselves between the two sides.
- Expectation (due to no interactions):

Since the particles do not interact and there are no forces favoring one side over the other, we expect the particles to be evenly distributed. This means that, on average, we expect half of the molecules to be on one side and half on the other side.
- Why does this happen?

Because there is nothing favoring one side over the other, the system is equally likely to find itself in a state where both particles are on one side or one particle is on each side. However, there are more ways to arrange the particles such that they are evenly distributed between the two compartments than there are ways to put both particles on one side. This is due to multiplicity $(\Omega)$.


Microstates and Multiplicity:
- Consider two particles and two compartments:
- One possible arrangement is both particles on the left side (1 microstate).
- Another possible arrangement is both particles on the right side (1 microstate).
- However, if one particle is on the left and the other is on the right, there are two possible microstates (because either particle could be in either compartment).

This gives:
- $\Omega=1$ for both particles on the left,
- $\Omega=1$ for both particles on the right,
- $\Omega=2$ for one particle in each compartment.

Since the multiplicity is highest when the particles are evenly distributed, this configuration is the most probable. The system tends to favor the configuration with the highest entropy, which in this case is the even distribution of particles.

Entropy and Likelihood:
- The larger the number of microstates $\Omega$, the higher the entropy ( S ) of the system. Therefore, the configuration with the most microstates (one particle on each side) will have the highest entropy and will be the most likely configuration for the system to adopt.
- This concept applies more broadly to systems with larger numbers of particles. As the number of particles increases, the most probable macrostate will be the one where the particles are evenly distributed because it has the greatest number of microstates (i.e., the highest multiplicity $\Omega$ ).


![[Pasted image 20241022161530.png]]


The image depicts an example illustrating the concept of **microstates** and **multiplicity (Ω)** in an **ideal gas** confined in a box. This example is likely meant to explain the basics of **statistical mechanics** and how the **distribution of particles** leads to different possible configurations or microstates.

### Breakdown of the Example:

1. **Ideal Gas in a Box:**
   - The system consists of **N = 2** particles (labeled 1 and 2) confined to a box that is divided into two halves. The particles can move between the two sides.
   
2. **Different Microstates (Configurations):**
   - The image shows different ways the particles can be distributed between the two halves of the box. The various possible configurations of particles are known as **microstates**.
   - The possible configurations are:
     - Both particles on the **left** side of the box.
     - Both particles on the **right** side of the box.
     - Particle 1 on the left and particle 2 on the right.
     - Particle 2 on the left and particle 1 on the right.

3. **Multiplicity (Ω):**
   - **Multiplicity (Ω)** refers to the number of distinct microstates that correspond to a particular macrostate (a macrostate being the observable state of the system, such as the total number of particles in each half of the box).
   
   - In the example:
     - When **both particles are on one side of the box**, there is only **one possible microstate** for each configuration (left or right), so the **multiplicity (Ω) = 1**.
     - When **one particle is on the left and the other is on the right**, there are **two possible microstates** (particle 1 on the left, particle 2 on the right, or vice versa). Hence, the **multiplicity (Ω) = 2**.

4. **Key Takeaway:**
   - This example illustrates that the more evenly distributed the particles are (in this case, one particle on each side of the box), the **higher the multiplicity (Ω)** and, therefore, the **greater the entropy** of the system.
   - Systems tend to evolve toward macrostates with **higher multiplicity** because they correspond to more possible microstates, which means they are statistically more likely to occur.

### Summary:
The figure is illustrating the idea that, in a system of particles, different distributions (microstates) correspond to different levels of multiplicity (Ω). The system tends to favor configurations with higher multiplicity, which is tied to higher entropy. In this example of an ideal gas, the distribution where the particles are spread more evenly across the box has a higher multiplicity and, thus, higher entropy. This is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.


![[Pasted image 20241022161601.png]]


This image is illustrating the concept of **multiplicity (Ω)** and **microstates** for a system of **N = 10** particles distributed between two compartments, further expanding on the statistical mechanics concept from your previous example.

### Breakdown of the Diagram:

1. **N = 10 particles:**
   - In this system, there are 10 particles, which are being distributed between two compartments. The different configurations in which these particles can be arranged are called **microstates**, and the total number of configurations is referred to as the **multiplicity (Ω)**.

2. **Macrostates vs. Microstates:**
   - **Macrostate:** A macrostate refers to the overall distribution of particles between the two compartments (e.g., 5 particles in one compartment and 5 in the other). This is denoted in large boxes.
   - **Microstate:** A microstate refers to a specific configuration of particles that produces a given macrostate. For example, in a 5-5 macrostate, there are multiple specific arrangements of particles (e.g., which exact 5 particles are in each compartment), and each of these specific arrangements is a microstate.

3. **Different Configurations (Microstates) and Multiplicity (Ω):**
   - The top and bottom macrostates represent **extreme configurations**, where all particles are on one side:
     - When **all 10 particles are in one compartment** (e.g., 0-10 or 10-0), there is only **one microstate**, so the multiplicity \( Ω = 1 \).
   - For **intermediate configurations**, the multiplicity increases:
     - For example, in the 1-9 macrostate (1 particle on one side, 9 on the other), there are **10 possible microstates** (because there are 10 ways to place 1 particle in a compartment), so \( Ω = 10 \).
     - For the 2-8 macrostate, there are \( Ω = 45 \) microstates.
   
4. **Most Likely Configuration:**
   - The **most likely configuration** is the one where the particles are **evenly distributed** (or close to evenly distributed) between the compartments.
     - In this case, the **5-5 macrostate** is the most likely, with **252 microstates**. This is highlighted as the configuration with the **highest multiplicity**, meaning there are more ways to achieve this configuration than any other.
     - In systems with large numbers of particles, the macrostate with the largest number of microstates is statistically the most likely to occur.

5. **Multiplicity and Statistical Likelihood:**
   - The number of microstates \( Ω \) tells us how **statistically likely** a given macrostate is. The higher the multiplicity, the more likely that macrostate is to be observed.
   - In this example, the **5-5 configuration** (most equal distribution) is the most probable, as there are more ways to achieve it compared to other macrostates. The extreme configurations (0-10, 10-0) are the least likely because they have very few microstates.

### Summary:
The image illustrates that, for **N = 10** particles, the distribution of particles between two compartments follows the principle of **multiplicity (Ω)**. The macrostate where particles are **evenly distributed** (5-5) is the most likely configuration because it has the highest number of microstates, making it the most probable. The more extreme configurations (0-10, 10-0) have fewer microstates and are therefore less likely. This concept is fundamental in **statistical mechanics**, as it explains why systems tend to favor states with higher entropy (more microstates).


Let's explore the concepts you're referring to, particularly how entropy sometimes promotes order, using the example of hard spheres in a colloidal system and the formation of an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) crystal.

Entropy and Microstates:
- Macrostate and Microstates:

As you mentioned, a macrostate with more microstates is more likely to be observed. The 5050 particle distribution in the ideal gas example had 252 microstates, which made it the most probable macrostate due to the high number of equivalent configurations.

Example of Entropy Driving Order: Hard Spheres in Colloids
This is an interesting case where entropy drives the system from a disordered to an ordered structure, which might seem counterintuitive, as entropy is usually associated with disorder. However, in this scenario, ordering actually increases the number of microstates, and therefore the entropy.

Hard Sphere System:
- In a hard sphere colloidal system, the particles (spheres) do not interact via attractive or repulsive forces; they only experience excluded volume interactions, meaning they cannot overlap, but otherwise, they do not "feel" each other.
- At low packing fractions (volume fractions), these hard spheres are disordered and can move freely, much like a gas. As the volume fraction increases, the spheres pack more tightly.


Why Does an FCC Crystal Form?
- Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal:

In certain conditions, particularly when the volume fraction of the hard spheres exceeds a threshold (around $\phi \approx 0.55$ ), the system undergoes a phase transition from a disordered state to an FCC crystal structure. The FCC crystal is a highly ordered structure where each sphere is positioned in a highly regular, close-packed arrangement.

The Role of Entropy:
- Why does the system become more ordered (form an FCC crystal)?

This is where the counterintuitive part comes in. Even though the system is becoming more ordered (going from a disordered fluid state to an ordered crystal state), the transition is driven by entropy.
- Increased microstates:

When the system is more densely packed, the spheres in the FCC structure have more available microstates (positions and arrangements) than they would in a disordered, more constrained packing. In the fluid-like disordered state, the hard spheres are tightly constrained by their neighbors, which limits their possible configurations. In the FCC structure, the spheres are arranged in a way that maximizes free volume and, paradoxically, increases the system's overall entropy by increasing the number of equivalent microstates.
- Entropy-driven phase transition:

This is an example of an entropy-driven first-order phase transition. The system spontaneously transitions from a disordered, fluid-like phase to an ordered FCC crystal because this maximizes the entropy. This might seem contradictory, as we usually associate higher entropy with disorder, but in this case, the ordered phase has more accessible microstates.

Phase Diagram ( $\phi \approx 0.55$ ):
- Volume fraction $(\phi)$ is a key parameter in describing the phase behavior of colloidal systems. When the volume fraction of hard spheres reaches a critical value (around $\phi \approx 0.55$ ), the system undergoes a transition to a crystalline phase, typically an FCC crystal.
- Disordered to ordered transition:

At this threshold, the system transitions from a disordered fluid-like state to a more ordered crystalline state (such as FCC). This transition increases the number of microstates, thus increasing entropy, which is why the ordered phase is favored at high volume fractions.

Summary:
- In the case of hard sphere colloidal systems, increasing the density of the spheres can lead to the formation of an FCC crystal-a highly ordered phase.
- Entropy drives this transition, even though the system becomes more ordered. This happens because the FCC structure allows for more microstates than a disordered arrangement, leading to a higher overall entropy.
- This is an example of an entropy-driven first-order phase transition, where the system transitions from a disordered to an ordered state as the volume fraction of spheres increases.

This example shows that entropy doesn't always correlate with disorder. Sometimes, ordering the system can increase the number of available configurations (microstates), thus increasing entropy and making the ordered state more favorable.


# Crystal Surface and Roughening Transition


When a crystal is heated, it can undergo several transformations before it reaches its melting temperature $\left(T_m\right)$. One of these transformations is the roughening transition, which occurs at a temperature somewhat below the melting point.

What Happens as We Increase Temperature?
1. Melting Temperature $\left(T_m\right):$
- As you approach the melting temperature $\left(T_m\right)$, the crystal gains enough thermal energy for the atoms to break free from their fixed positions in the crystal lattice, and the material transitions to a molten state (liquid). This is the well-known melting process.
2. Before the Melting Point - Roughening Transition:
- Before the crystal melts, as the temperature increases, something else can happen at a fraction of the melting temperature, typically around 0.5 to $0.7 T_m$. This is called the roughening transition.
3. Roughening Transition:
- The roughening transition occurs when the atoms at the surface of the crystal gain enough kinetic energy that the surface is no longer smooth. The atoms start to move more freely at the surface, leading to an increase in surface disorder or roughness.
- At temperatures below this transition, the crystal surface remains relatively smooth and wellordered. However, as the temperature approaches $\mathbf{0 . 5 - 0 . 7} T_m$, the surface energy and atomic vibrations increase to the point where the surface becomes rough.
- This roughened surface occurs because the higher thermal energy allows the atoms to explore more configurations. The surface atoms have fewer neighboring atoms compared to the bulk atoms, so they are more easily displaced, leading to a loss of smoothness at elevated temperatures.


4. Surface Energy and Free Energy Changes:
- As the temperature rises, the free energy of the system can shift, affecting the balance between surface energy and entropy. This can lead to the roughening transition because the increased temperature allows for more atomic movement and rearrangement at the surface, favoring rough configurations that increase entropy.
- The roughening temperature is usually below the melting temperature because the system first minimizes the surface energy through surface roughening before completely breaking down into the molten state. The roughening transition serves as a precursor to the eventual melting of the crystal.
5. Temperature Dependence:
- As you continue to increase the temperature toward the melting point, the kinetic energy of the surface atoms becomes sufficient to break the cohesive forces that maintain the crystal lattice, leading to the complete loss of structural integrity and melting.

Summary:
- Melting temperature $\left(T_m\right)$ : This is the temperature at which the entire crystal melts into a liquid state.
- Roughening transition: At 0.5 to $0.7 T_m$, the surface of the crystal begins to roughen due to the increased kinetic energy of the surface atoms, making the surface less smooth. This transition occurs before the crystal fully melts.
- Free energy and surface energy: The surface free energy can shift with temperature, and the roughening transition occurs when the surface free energy no longer favors a smooth surface, but instead favors a rough surface due to increased entropy.


In practical terms, as you approach the roughening transition, the surface atoms become more mobile and the surface structure becomes increasingly irregular. Only after passing the roughening transition and continuing to heat the system will you reach the melting point, where the crystal lattice completely disintegrates into a liquid.



# Typical Values of Surface Tension and Interfacial Tension for Liquids
The surface tension and interfacial tension are crucial properties when dealing with liquids and their interfaces. These values represent the amount of energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid or the energy at the interface between two immiscible phases. Let's break down the examples you've provided.
1. Surface Tension of Liquids in Contact with Air

Surface tension $(\gamma)$ is the energy per unit area required to increase the surface area of a liquid. It is usually measured in $\mathrm{mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2$ (millijoules per square meter) or dyn/cm.
- Air-Water Interface:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-water }}=72 \mathrm{~mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2
$$


Water has relatively high surface tension due to its strong hydrogen bonding. This high surface tension causes water to form droplets and resist spreading easily.
- Air-Mercury Interface:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-mercury }}=476 \mathrm{~mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2
$$


Mercury has one of the highest surface tensions among liquids due to strong metallic bonding between atoms. This is why mercury forms beads on surfaces and does not wet most materials-its surface tension is so high that it minimizes its contact area with surfaces, preferring to form spherical droplets.


- Air-Hexane Interface:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-hexane }}=18 \mathrm{~mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2
$$


Hexane, a nonpolar hydrocarbon, has a much lower surface tension than water because it lacks strong intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding or metallic bonding. As a result, it spreads more easily on surfaces and does not form strong droplets.
- Air-Benzene Interface:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-benzene }}=35 \mathrm{~mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2
$$


Benzene, another nonpolar liquid, has a surface tension that is higher than hexane but still significantly lower than water. This is due to its relatively weak intermolecular interactions.

2. Interfacial Tension Between Two Immiscible Liquids

Interfacial tension ( $\gamma_{\alpha \beta}$ ) or interfacial energy occurs between two immiscible phases, like oil and water. It represents the energy required to create a unit area of interface between two different liquids. Typically, the interfacial tension between immiscible liquids is lower than the surface tension of a liquid in contact with air, but it is still significant due to the different molecular interactions between the two phases.
- Hexane-Water Interface:

$$
\gamma_{\text {hexane-water }}=50 \mathrm{~mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2
$$


The interfacial tension between hexane and water is relatively high because hexane is nonpolar while water is highly polar. The difference in molecular interactions between these two liquids (no hydrogen bonding in hexane) leads to a significant interfacial energy.
- Benzene-Water Interface:

$$
\gamma_{\text {benzene-water }}=35 \mathrm{~mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2
$$


The interfacial tension between benzene and water is lower than that of hexane and water but still considerable. Benzene is also nonpolar and immiscible with water, but the interactions are slightly different than with hexane due to the aromatic structure of benzene.
3. Why Does Mercury Form Beads?

As mentioned, mercury has an extremely high surface tension $\left(476 \mathrm{~mJ} / \mathrm{m}^2\right)$, which causes it to minimize its surface area dramatically. The surface tension of mercury is so strong that it cannot wet most surfaces and forms nearly perfect spherical beads when placed on most solid materials. These beads are the result of mercury's desire to reduce its surface area due to the large energy cost associated with increasing it.





# Measuring Surface Tension


![[Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 16.33.03.png]]


Measuring Surface Tension Using Contact Angles
One of the simplest methods for measuring surface tension is through contact angle measurement. This method is commonly used when you don't have access to specialized equipment, as it only requires a liquid droplet and a solid surface. The contact angle provides valuable information about the wetting behavior of the liquid on the solid surface, which is directly related to surface tension.
1. Contact Angle Basics:
- The contact angle is the angle formed at the interface between the liquid and the solid surface, measured inside the liquid drop where the liquid, solid, and air (or another gas) meet.
- It provides a measure of how well the liquid "wets" the surface:
- A low contact angle (less than $90^{\circ}$ ) indicates that the liquid spreads out or wets the surface well.
- A high contact angle (greater than $90^{\circ}$ ) indicates poor wetting, meaning the liquid tends to form beads rather than spread.
2. Forces Acting on a Liquid Droplet at Equilibrium:

When a liquid drop is placed on a solid surface, it reaches equilibrium through a balance of forces. These forces are:
- Surface tension of the liquid-gas interface $\left(\gamma_{l g}\right)$ : This is the surface tension of the liquid in contact with air or another gas.
- Surface tension of the solid-liquid interface $\left(\gamma_{s l}\right)$ : This is the surface tension between the solid and the liquid.
- Surface tension of the solid-gas interface $\left(\gamma_{s g}\right)$ : This is the surface tension between the solid and the surrounding gas (often air).

3. Young's Equation:

To describe the balance of forces at the contact line where the liquid, solid, and gas meet, we use Young's equation. This equation relates the contact angle $(\theta)$ to the surface tensions of the system:

$$
\gamma_{s g}=\gamma_{s l}+\gamma_{l g} \cdot \cos (\theta)
$$


Where:
- $\gamma_{s g}=$ surface tension between solid and gas,
- $\gamma_{s l}=$ surface tension between solid and liquid,
- $\gamma_{l g}=$ surface tension between liquid and gas (or liquid-air),
- $\theta=$ contact angle.
4. Force Balance and Equilibrium:

The total forces in the system must sum to zero because the droplet is in mechanical equilibrium. These forces act at the three-phase contact line where the solid, liquid, and gas phases meet:
- The liquid-gas surface tension $\left(\gamma_{l g}\right)$ pulls tangentially along the liquid-gas interface.
- The solid-liquid surface tension ( $\gamma_{s l}$ ) pulls tangentially along the solid-liquid interface.
- The solid-gas surface tension $\left(\gamma_{s g}\right)$ pulls tangentially along the solid-gas interface.

At equilibrium, these forces balance out, which is why the contact angle is a function of these surface tensions, as captured in Young's equation.



5. Interpreting Contact Angles:
- If $\theta$ is small (closer to $0^{\circ}$ ), the liquid spreads easily, wetting the surface, which indicates strong adhesion between the liquid and the solid. This corresponds to a low solid-liquid surface tension $\left(\gamma_{s l}\right)$.
- If $\theta$ is large (closer to $180^{\circ}$ ), the liquid forms beads, meaning it poorly wets the surface, indicating weak adhesion and high solid-liquid surface tension.
6. Practical Applications:
- Contact angle measurement is used to estimate surface tensions and infer wettability properties of surfaces, such as in coatings, paints, and adhesives.
- It is also used to study hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties of surfaces, in applications like waterproof coatings or self-cleaning surfaces.

Summary:
- Contact angle measurement is a simple and effective way to infer surface tension when you lack sophisticated equipment.
- Young's equation relates the contact angle to the surface tensions at the liquid-gas, liquidsolid, and solid-gas interfaces.
- In equilibrium, the total forces in the system (surface tensions) must balance, which is why the contact angle is a key indicator of surface tension and wetting behavior.
