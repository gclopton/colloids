Capillary wave theory deals with the fluctuations of a fluid surface due to thermal energy. It helps to describe the wavy nature of liquid surfaces, especially at small scales where molecular interactions and thermal motion significantly influence the surface.


1. Describing the Surface Mathematically:

The surface of a liquid can be described mathematically using a Fourier series. In capillary wave theory, the height of the surface, $h(x,y)$, at a point $(x,y)$ can be expressed as a sum of sinusoidal modes (waves) with different wavelengths. This allows you to represent the surface fluctuations as a superposition of waves:

$$\begin{equation*}
h(x,y)=\sum _{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}} e^{i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} +a_{\mathbf{k}}^{*} e^{-i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}
\end{equation*}$$

$$\displaystyle \boxed{ \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\mathbf{k} \ \equiv \ the\ wavevector\ ( which\ corresponds\ to\ the\ spatial\ frequency\ of\ the\ waves)\\
a_{\mathbf{k}} \equiv \ the\ Fourier\ coefficients\ that\ depend\ on\ the\ amplitude\ of\ each\ mode
\end{array}}$$

2. Expression for Reversible Work $W$ :

The reversible work $W$ required to create a surface (or interface) is related to the surface tension $\gamma$, which is defined as the energy per unit area. The work done to create an additional surface area $dA$ is:

$$\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{Work\ Done\ to\ Create\ Additional\ Surface\ Area:}}\\
dW=\gamma dA\\
\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{W\equiv reversible\ work}}\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{\gamma \equiv surface\ tension}}\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{dA\equiv additional\ surface\ area}}
\end{array}}
\end{equation*}$$

The total work to create a new surface from an initially flat one can be obtained by integrating over the total surface area change.



3. Proportionality to Surface Tension:

Surface tension $\gamma $ plays a crucial role in the stability of the surface. For a liquid like water, the surface energy per unit area is typically positive because creating new surface area (which increases the number of molecules at the interface) costs energy. This is what makes interfaces between different phases (e.g., liquid and air) form in a way that minimizes the total surface area.


4. Free Energy $F$ :

The free energy $F$ of the system is influenced by the surface tension and the entropy associated with surface fluctuations. For small perturbations (like capillary waves), the free energy can be calculated as a function of the surface height $h(x,y)$ by integrating over all modes $\mathbf{k}$ :


$$\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{Free\ Energy\ F:}}\\
F=\frac{1}{2}\sum _{\mathbf{k}} \gamma k^{2}| a_{\mathbf{k}}| ^{2}
\end{array}}
\end{equation*}$$


This expression shows that larger wavevectors (shorter wavelengths) contribute more to the free energy, which corresponds to smaller and more frequent surface fluctuations.

5. Zero-Order Estimate:


To estimate the energy required to pull a small cylinder up from the surface, consider a cylindrical protrusion of height $z$ and radius $r$. The surface area of the side of this cylinder is approximately $A=2\pi rz$, and the energy required to create this surface is:

$$\begin{equation*}
E=\gamma A=\gamma 2\pi rz
\end{equation*}$$


This is a simple estimate based on the idea that pulling up the cylinder increases the surface area by $2\pi rz$, and the energy is proportional to this new surface area.


6. Probability of the Cylinder Sticking Out:

The probability that a small cylinder randomly sticks out from the water surface can be estimated using the Boltzmann factor, which relates the probability of a fluctuation to the energy associated with that fluctuation. The probability $P$ of finding a surface perturbation (like a small cylinder) with energy $E$ is:

$$\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{The\ probability\ P\ of\ finding\ a\ surface\ perturbation\ }\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{(}\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{like\ a\ small\ cylinder}\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{)}\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{\ with\ energy\ E}}\\
P\varpropto \exp\left( -\frac{E}{k_{B} T}\right)\\
\boxed{ \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\ k_{B} \ \equiv Boltzmann\ constant\\
T\ \equiv temperature\\
E=\gamma 2\pi rz\ 
\end{array}}
\end{array}}
\end{equation*}$$

where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. Inserting the energy $E=\gamma 2\pi rz$ gives:

$$\begin{equation*}
P\varpropto \exp\left( -\frac{\gamma 2\pi rz}{k_{B} T}\right)
\end{equation*}$$


This shows that the likelihood of a cylinder of height $z$ spontaneously forming on the surface decreases exponentially with increasing energy (or increasing surface area). The larger the value of $\gamma $, the less probable such a fluctuation is, because higher surface tension suppresses surface deformations.


Additional Considerations:
- Thermal Fluctuations: Thermal fluctuations are the main driver of capillary waves at the microscopic level. The surface will constantly undergo small perturbations, but the energy cost of large fluctuations makes them less likely.
- Wavelength dependence: Larger wavelength fluctuations are more common, as they require less energy than smaller wavelength fluctuations. This is captured in the expression for free energy, where shorter wavelengths contribute more to the energy cost.


Boltzmann Distribution (Boltzmann Factor)

The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability of a system being in a particular state $i$ with energy $\epsilon _{i}$ compared to another state $j$ with energy $\epsilon _{j}$. In the case you are describing, the energy difference $\Delta \epsilon $ between two states depends on the surface tension $\gamma$ and the geometrical characteristics of the system.

Expression for Relative Probability:
Given the relative probability between states $i$ and $j$ :

$$\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{R}\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{elative\ probability\ between\ states\ i\ and\ j:}}\\
\frac{P(i)}{P(j)} =e^{-\Delta \epsilon /k_{B} T}\\
\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{where:}}\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{P(i)\ \equiv is\ the\ probability\ of\ the\ system\ being\ in\ state\ i,}}\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{P(j)\ \equiv is\ the\ probability\ of\ being\ in\ state\ j,}}\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{\Delta \epsilon =\epsilon }\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{_{i}}\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{-\epsilon }\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{_{j}}\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{\ \equiv is\ the\ energy\ difference\ between\ the\ states,}}\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{k}\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{_{B}}\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{\ \equiv is\ the\ Boltzmann\ constant,}}\\
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0.82,0.01,0.11}{T\ \equiv is\ the\ temperature.}}
\end{array}}
\end{equation*}$$


Energy Difference $\Delta \epsilon$ :
For a small cylindrical protrusion on a surface, the energy associated with creating the surface of the cylinder is proportional to the surface area. The surface energy is given by the product of the surface tension $\gamma$ and the surface area of the cylinder, which is $A=2\pi Rz$, where:
- $R$ is the radius of the cylinder,
- $z$ is the height of the cylinder.

Thus, the energy difference between the flat state (state $j$ ) and the state with the protruding cylinder (state $i$ ) is:

$$\begin{equation*}
\Delta \epsilon =\gamma \cdot 2\pi Rz
\end{equation*}$$


Relative Probability for Protrusion Formation:
Using the expression for $\Delta \epsilon $ in the Boltzmann factor:

$$\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
\mathbf{\textcolor[rgb]{0,0.3,1}{Relative\ Probability\ for\ Protrusion\ Formation:}}\\
\frac{P(i)}{P(j)} =e^{-\frac{\gamma \cdot 2\pi Rz}{k_{B} T}}
\end{array}}
\end{equation*}$$


This shows that the probability of finding a protruding cylinder (state $i$ ) compared to a flat surface (state $j$ ) decreases exponentially with the energy required to create the surface, which in turn depends on the surface tension $\gamma $, the dimensions of the cylinder $R$ and $z$, and the thermal energy $k_{B} T$.

Key Insights:
- The larger the surface tension $\gamma $, the less probable it is to observe protrusions.
- As the cylinder's radius $R$ or height $z$ increases, the energy cost becomes higher, and the probability of the protrusion forming decreases.
- The probability also depends on temperature: at higher temperatures (larger $T$ ), the system has more thermal energy, making protrusions more probable.


Estimating the Volume of a Water Molecule:


Volume of a Cylinder:
The volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by:

$$\begin{equation*}
V=\pi R^{2} z
\end{equation*}$$

where:
- $R$ is the radius of the cylinder,
- $z$ is the height of the cylinder.

Water Properties:
- The density of water is $\rho _{\mathrm{H}_{2} O} =1000\frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}^{3}}$.
- The molecular mass of water $\mu =18\frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{mol}}$.

The molar volume $V$ of water can be approximated as:

$$\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{\mu }{\rho } =\frac{18\frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{mol}}}{1000\frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}^{3}}} \sim 1.8\times 10^{-2}\frac{\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\mathrm{kmol}}
\end{equation*}$$


Estimation of the Volume of a Water Molecule:
To estimate the volume of a single water molecule, we use the molar volume divided by Avogadro's number $N_{A} =6.022\times 10^{26}\frac{1}{\mathrm{kmol}}$ :

$$\begin{equation*}
V_{\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}} =\frac{V}{N_{A}} =\frac{1.8\times 10^{-2}\frac{\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\mathrm{kmol}}}{6.022\times 10^{26}\frac{1}{\mathrm{kmol}}} \approx 3\times 10^{-29}\mathrm{\sim m}^{3}
\end{equation*}$$


This is an approximation of the volume occupied by a single water molecule.
Since $1\AA =10^{-10}\mathrm{\sim m}$, we can estimate the linear dimension of a water molecule as:

$$\begin{equation*}
V_{\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}}^{1/3} \sim \left( 3\times 10^{-29}\right)^{1/3} \sim 30\AA 
\end{equation*}$$


This is consistent with the idea that water molecules are on the order of a few angstroms in size.


Boltzmann Factor and Surface Waves:
The expression you have:

$$\begin{equation*}
e^{\frac{-\gamma 2\pi Rz}{k_{B} T}} =e^{-\frac{z}{\lambda _{0}}}
\end{equation*}$$

represents how the probability of forming a surface protrusion decreases exponentially with the height $z$ of the protrusion. Here, $\lambda _{0}$ is a characteristic decay length that depends on the surface tension $\gamma $, temperature $T$, and Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$.
- Surface tension $\gamma $ affects how quickly surface fluctuations decay.
- A higher $\gamma $ (stronger surface tension) leads to shorter decay lengths $\lambda _{0}$, meaning surface roughness decreases because protrusions decay more rapidly.
- Decay length $\lambda _{0}$ is an important parameter that determines the typical scale over which thermal fluctuations are suppressed by surface tension.

Sphere Radius and Surface Tension:
- The surface tension of water is $\gamma =72\frac{\mathrm{mJ}}{\mathrm{m}^{2}}$.
- The typical radius $R$ of a protrusion or water molecule is approximately $2\AA $, which is about the size of a water molecule.
- The Boltzmann constant $k_{B} \approx 1.38\times 10^{-23}\frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{K}}$.
- The temperature $T$ is approximately room temperature, $T=298\mathrm{\sim K}$.


Surface Waves and Surface Tension:
The relationship between surface waves and surface tension is critical for understanding the roughness of liquid surfaces. The higher the surface tension $\gamma $, the more the surface resists being deformed by thermal fluctuations, and the decay length $\lambda _{0}$ of those fluctuations decreases. This means that small waves or protrusions on the surface are more likely to be smoothed out as $\gamma $ increases.

In summary:
- As surface tension $\gamma $ increases, the system suppresses large fluctuations, leading to a smoother surface.
- The characteristic decay length $\lambda _{0}$ determines how quickly fluctuations in the height of the surface decay.

### What was the purpose of estimating the volume of a water molecule?
The purpose of estimating the volume of a water molecule in the context of capillary wave theory and surface fluctuations is to:
1. Understand the scale of surface fluctuations: In capillary wave theory, the amplitude and wavelength of surface fluctuations are directly related to the molecular properties of the liquid. By estimating the volume of a single water molecule, you get a sense of the typical spatial scale of molecular interactions that contribute to surface roughness and fluctuations.
2. Relate molecular size to surface protrusions: If you are considering a model where small cylindrical protrusions or waves form on a water surface, knowing the volume of a water molecule helps estimate how many molecules are involved in these deformations. It helps you compare the size of the protrusion or wave to the scale of molecular dimensions, giving a physical context to the mathematical models.
3. Connect molecular volume to surface energy: The surface energy of the water is related to the molecular interactions at the interface. Estimating the volume of a water molecule helps understand how much energy is required to change the surface configuration (e.g., by pulling up a protrusion or forming a wave), since this energy is influenced by the number of molecules involved in creating the new surface area.
4. Compare with the decay length of surface fluctuations: In capillary wave theory, the characteristic decay length $\lambda _{0}$ determines how quickly surface fluctuations are suppressed. This length scale can be compared with the size of a water molecule to determine whether thermal fluctuations on the surface are dominated by molecular-scale interactions or larger-scale surface waves.


## work needed to create interface or fluctuation



The work needed to create an interface or fluctuation, as described by the equation you provided, involves two terms: one related to the energy due to the density difference between two phases (e.g., two fluids or a fluid and air), and another related to the surface tension of the interface.

Breakdown of the Work Expression:

$$\begin{equation*}
W=( \rho _{1} -\rho _{2})\int _{A}\left(\int _{S(x,y)} U_{e} (z)dz\right) dxdy+\gamma _{0}\int _{A}\left( 1+\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x} \xi (x,y)\right)^{2} +\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial y} \xi (x,y)\right)^{2}\right)^{1/2} dxdy
\end{equation*}$$

1. Term 1: Volume Energy (Density Difference Contribution):
- $\rho _{1}$ and $\rho _{2}$ are the densities of the two phases (e.g., a liquid and air).
- The integral $\int _{S(x,y)} U_{e} (z)dz$ describes the energy contribution due to some external potential $U_{e} (z)$, which could represent gravitational potential energy or some other field acting on the system.
- The overall term $( \rho _{1} -\rho _{2})\int _{A}\left(\int _{S(x,y)} U_{e} (z)dz\right) dxdy$ captures the work required to create the fluctuation in the presence of this density difference, integrated over the surface area $A$.

2. Term 2: Surface Energy (Surface Tension Contribution):
- $\gamma _{0}$ is the "bare" interfacial tension, which is the surface tension of the flat interface before fluctuations.
- $\xi (x,y)$ represents the height of the surface at a given point $(x,y)$, so $\frac{\partial }{\partial x} \xi (x,y)$ and $\frac{\partial }{\partial y} \xi (x,y)$ are the slopes of the surface in the $x$ - and $y$-directions.
- The expression $\left( 1+\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x} \xi (x,y)\right)^{2} +\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial y} \xi (x,y)\right)^{2}\right)^{1/2}$ accounts for the increase in surface area due to fluctuations, i.e., how much additional area is created by bending the surface. When there are no fluctuations, this term is just 1 , corresponding to the flat surface.

Probability of Finding a Surface $\xi (x,y)$ :
The probability $P(\xi (x,y))$ of observing a surface configuration $\xi (x,y)$ is related to the work $W$ required to create that surface by the Boltzmann factor:

$$\begin{equation*}
P(\xi (x,y))\sim e^{-W/k_{B} T}
\end{equation*}$$


This expression states that configurations requiring more work (higher energy) are less probable, with the likelihood decreasing exponentially as the energy increases. The ratio $W/k_{B} T$ compares the work needed to create the fluctuation with the thermal energy available in the system.


Fourier Series Representation of the Surface:
You also provided the assumption that the surface fluctuation $\xi (x,y)$ can be written as a sum of Fourier modes:

$$\begin{equation*}
\xi (x,y)=\sum _{\vec{k}} a_{k} e^{i\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}}
\end{equation*}$$

where:
- $\vec{k}$ is the wavevector, which determines the wavelength and direction of each Fourier mode,
- $a_{k}$ are the Fourier coefficients, representing the amplitude of each mode.

This Fourier series description captures the idea that the surface can be decomposed into a set of capillary waves, each with its own amplitude and wavelength.

Capillary Waves and Surface Tension:
- Capillary waves are small fluctuations on the surface of a liquid, driven by thermal energy and modulated by the surface tension $\gamma $.
- The surface tension resists the creation of these waves, so higher surface tension tends to suppress large fluctuations.
- Confinement effects: When a liquid is confined to a small region, the measured surface tension $\gamma$ may appear larger than in an unconfined system. This is because the confinement alters the distribution of capillary waves-certain long-wavelength modes may be suppressed, effectively increasing the energy required to deform the surface.
