## GISAXS
### Basic Principles of GISAXS:
- **Grazing Incidence:** In GISAXS, the X-ray beam strikes the sample at a very shallow angle, typically just above the critical angle for total external reflection. This grazing incidence is critical for probing surface and near-surface structures with high sensitivity. The angle of 0.20 degrees you mentioned is an example of a small incident angle, ensuring that the X-rays penetrate only a thin layer of the material, ideal for studying nanostructures and thin films.
- **2D Detector (Image Plate):** GISAXS typically uses a 2D detector to capture scattering patterns. The detector records the distribution of scattered intensity, which arises due to the interaction of the incident X-rays with the sample's electron density variations. These intensity distributions provide indirect information about the nanostructures on or near the sample surface.
### **GISAXS Pattern:**
- The scattering pattern is essentially a 2D intensity map. From this pattern, you can extract information about the size, shape, and orientation of nanoscale structures. The key quantities measured in GISAXS are the scattering vector $q$ (related to the incident and scattered angles) and the intensity of scattered X-rays.
- **Scattering vector (q):** The magnitude of the scattering vector, $q$, is defined as:

$$
q=\frac{4 \pi}{\lambda} \sin (\theta)
$$

where $\lambda$ is the $X$-ray wavelength and $\theta$ is half the scattering angle. The scattering vector describes the inverse length scales of the structures being probed (e.g., if $q$ is small, you are probing larger structures).
- The 2D pattern consists of specular reflection (where the scattering angle equals the incident angle) and diffuse scattering from the surface roughness and internal structures.

### **Scattering Intensities vs. Atomic Locations:**
- **Scattering Intensity:** As you pointed out, GISAXS does not directly give atomic positions. Instead, the scattering intensity is related to the Fourier transform of the electron density variations in the sample. By analyzing the intensity distribution at different $q$-values, you infer the structural features at the nanoscale.
- **Structure Determination:** To extract structural information, you perform data analysis and modeling, often using inverse Fourier transforms and fitting the GISAXS data with models that simulate the expected scattering from known or hypothesized nanostructures (such as cylinders, spheres, or lamellae). The process of reconstructing the real-space structure from the scattering pattern is non-trivial and requires assumptions about the shape, arrangement, and electron density contrast of the structures.


## STM

### Basic Principle of STM:

STM operates on the principle of quantum tunneling, a phenomenon where electrons can move through a potential barrier (in this case, the gap between the STM tip and the sample surface) even when classical mechanics would forbid it.
- **Tunneling Current:** When a sharp, conductive tip is brought very close (on the order of angstroms) to the surface of a conductive or semi-conductive sample, and a bias voltage is applied between the tip and the sample, electrons tunnel through the vacuum gap. The magnitude of the tunneling current depends exponentially on the tip-sample distance, meaning that extremely small changes in distance lead to large changes in current.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** In constant-current mode, the STM maintains a constant tunneling current by adjusting the tip's vertical position. The tip's height at each point is recorded to form a topographic map of the surface with atomic resolution. In constant-height mode, the tip's height remains fixed, and variations in the current reflect surface topography.
2. Quantum Tunneling and Exponential Sensitivity:

The tunneling current $I$ is highly sensitive to the distance $d$ between the tip and the surface, following the approximate relation:

$$
I \propto e^{-\kappa d}
$$

where $\kappa$ is a constant related to the properties of the tip and sample, and $d$ is the distance between them. This sensitivity makes STM capable of detecting changes in height as small as fractions of an angstrom, providing atomic-scale resolution.

3. Tip and Sample Requirements:
- Conductivity: The sample must be electrically conductive or semi-conductive to allow for tunneling. Insulating materials cannot be directly imaged by STM unless they are coated with a conductive layer.
- Tip Composition: The tip is typically made from a conductive material like tungsten or platinum-iridium. The sharpness of the tip is crucial because the tunneling current is most sensitive to the atom at the very end of the tip. Ideally, the tip is atomically sharp (ideally a single atom at the end).
4. STM Imaging and Data:

STM generates images by scanning the tip across the surface while recording the vertical position of the tip or the current at each $(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y})$ coordinate.
- Topography: STM can create detailed maps of the surface's electronic structure. The atomic resolution allows for imaging individual atoms, defects, and even molecular orbitals in some cases.
- Electronic Structure: STM can also map local density of states (LDOS), providing information about the electronic properties of the surface. By varying the bias voltage, you can probe different energy states, making STM a powerful tool for studying the electronic properties of materials.
5. Tunneling Spectroscopy:

A variant of STM is Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS), where the tip is held at a fixed position, and the bias voltage is varied. This technique allows for measuring the energydependent tunneling current, which gives information about the electronic density of states of the sample.
- STS can be used to study the electronic band structure, superconducting gaps, and other phenomena related to the electronic properties of materials at the nanoscale.

### STM can operate in two different ways

Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) operates in two primary modes, each of which provides unique capabilities for surface analysis:
#### 1. Constant Height Mode:

In this mode, the STM tip is held at a constant height above the sample surface while scanning across it. The tunneling current, which is sensitive to the distance between the tip and the surface, varies as the surface topography changes. By monitoring these variations in current, an image of the surface can be constructed. This mode allows for rapid data acquisition and is particularly useful for observing flat surfaces. However, because the tipsample distance is fixed, this mode has a higher risk of tip crashes if the surface roughness is significant. Constant height mode is often used when imaging highly conductive or atomically flat surfaces, where small topographical variations are present.

#### 2. Constant Current Mode:

In constant current mode, the STM system continuously adjusts the tip's height to maintain a constant tunneling current as it scans over the sample. Since the tunneling current is exponentially dependent on the tip-sample distance, maintaining a constant current ensures that the tip follows the surface contour closely. The movement of the tip is recorded and used to generate a topographical map of the surface. This mode is slower than constant height mode but provides better resolution and is safer for imaging surfaces with significant topographical variations. Constant current mode is particularly useful for analyzing rough surfaces or materials with varying electronic properties, as it provides more accurate height information.

Both modes leverage the tunneling effect, where electrons quantum mechanically tunnel between the tip and the sample when they are brought within a few angstroms of each other. The choice of mode depends on the type of surface being studied and the resolution required.


#### Quantum Tunneling Effect

In classical physics, if a particle encounters a potential barrier with energy less than the barrier height, it would be reflected. However, in quantum mechanics, due to the wave-like nature of particles, there is a non-zero probability that the particle "tunnels" through the barrier even when its energy is less than the height of the barrier. This is possible because the particle's wavefunction decays exponentially inside the barrier, but doesn't immediately drop to zero, implying the possibility of the particle appearing on the other side.
2. Probe

In experimental setups, particularly in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), the probe refers to the sharp metallic tip that is brought extremely close to the sample's surface (on the scale of a few angstroms). This setup relies heavily on quantum tunneling to measure surface properties of materials at the atomic scale.
- Function of the Probe in Tunneling: The probe allows the system to be highly sensitive to the atomic-scale electronic structure of the surface. As the probe is brought closer to the surface, the distance between the probe and the sample determines the tunneling current. The closer the probe, the higher the probability of tunneling and the larger the tunneling current.
- Tunneling Tip Orbitals: The wavefunction of electrons in the probe's outermost atomic orbitals interacts with the wavefunction of the electrons in the sample. The alignment and shape of these orbitals are crucial in determining the tunneling characteristics.

3. Tunneling Current

The tunneling current arises when an external bias voltage is applied between the probe and the sample, creating an energy difference that enables electrons to tunnel across the gap. The magnitude of this current is directly proportional to the quantum tunneling probability and can be described by the Tersoff-Hamann model for STM.
- Mathematics: The tunneling current $I$ is given by an integral over the density of states (DOS) of both the probe and the sample, weighted by the tunneling probability and the Fermi-Dirac distribution. It is often expressed as:

$$
I(V) \propto \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \rho_{\text {sample }}(E) \rho_{\text {tip }}(E+e V)|M(E, V)|^2 d E
$$

where $\rho_{\text {sample }}(E)$ and $\rho_{\text {tip }}(E+e V)$ are the density of states of the sample and tip, respectively, and $|M(E, V)|^2$ represents the matrix element describing tunneling probability between states.
- Factors Influencing Tunneling Current: The current is highly sensitive to the distance $d$ between the tip and the surface and is exponentially dependent on it. The current can be approximated as:

$$
I(d) \propto e^{-2 \kappa d}
$$

where $\kappa$ is related to the effective mass and potential barrier height. This exponential relationship highlights the extreme sensitivity of tunneling to small variations in distance.

4. Quantum Tunneling Probability

The tunneling probability $T$ can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation by solving for the wavefunction inside the barrier region. For a one-dimensional rectangular potential barrier of height $V_0$ and width $a$, if the energy of the particle is $E<V_0$, the tunneling probability is approximately:

$$
T \propto e^{-2 \alpha a}
$$

where

$$
\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{2 m\left(V_0-E\right)}}{\hbar}
$$


This shows that tunneling probability depends on both the barrier width (the distance between the probe and the sample) and the height of the potential barrier (which relates to the energy difference between the states).
- Dependence on Orbitals: Quantum tunneling probability also depends on the overlap of the wavefunctions of the tip and sample, which in turn depends on the nature of the atomic orbitals involved. Orbitals with larger spatial extent (e.g., s-orbitals) can lead to a higher probability of tunneling compared to more localized orbitals (e.g., $d$-orbitals), as they result in a greater overlap between the wavefunctions of the probe and the sample.


5. Density of States (DOS)

The density of states (DOS) describes the number of available quantum states per energy interval at each energy level. In the context of tunneling, the DOS for both the probe and the sample plays a crucial role in determining the tunneling current. The DOS for a material does not decay to zero immediately beyond the Fermi level, which is important for tunneling.
- Localized vs Extended States: In materials with extended states (such as metals), the DOS might exhibit a relatively smooth variation near the Fermi energy. In localized states (such as defects or molecular orbitals), the DOS may display sharper features, affecting the tunneling characteristics.
- Decay of DOS: The DOS does not typically decay to zero immediately outside of the Fermi energy because of thermal effects (Fermi-Dirac distribution) and the quantum mechanical tails of electron wavefunctions. This non-zero DOS near the Fermi energy ensures that electrons at the tip can tunnel into the sample even if there is a small bias voltage.

The tunneling current is therefore not a sharp function of energy but instead depends on the convolution of the DOS of both the tip and the sample with the tunneling matrix element. Even for states slightly above or below the Fermi level, there is still a probability of tunneling due to this extended tail in the DOS.




#### Advantages of STM
1. Real-Space Imaging with Atomic Resolution
- STM provides extremely high spatial resolution due to its reliance on quantum tunneling. The lateral resolution can reach approximately 1.0 nm , allowing for imaging on the atomic scale, while the depth resolution can be as fine as 0.01 nm (or 10 picometers). This enables the observation of individual atoms and molecules on conductive surfaces, as well as the measurement of electronic properties with sub-angstrom precision.
- The ability to directly visualize surfaces in real space makes STM a highly valuable tool for studying surface topography, defects, and even the electronic structure of materials.
2. Versatility
- STM is extremely versatile because it can be applied to a wide variety of materials, as long as they are conductive or semiconducting. This versatility allows for the study of metals, alloys, semiconductors, and even some carbon-based nanostructures like graphene or nanotubes.
- In addition, STM can be used to investigate very flat surfaces with minimal roughness at the atomic scale, making it ideal for research in fields such as material science, surface chemistry, and nanotechnology. STM can also operate in different environments, such as ultra-high vacuum (UHV), air, or even liquids, depending on the experimental setup.


#### Disadvantages of STM
1. Expensive Equipment
- STM systems are typically very expensive, often costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. The cost arises from the need for specialized components such as ultra-precise positioning systems, vibration isolation systems, and complex electronics to control the tunneling current and probe-sample interaction.
2. Fragile Equipment
- The instruments are fragile and delicate, particularly the probe tips, which need to be maintained in an extremely sharp condition. The whole system, including the piezoelectric positioning stages and the feedback electronics, must be finely tuned and regularly maintained, which adds to the complexity and fragility of the system.
3. Environmental Sensitivity
- STM is highly sensitive to environmental disturbances, particularly vibrations. Even tiny mechanical vibrations, thermal drifts, or air currents can disrupt the tunneling current and degrade the image quality. To mitigate this, STM systems often need to be placed in highly controlled environments with excellent vibration isolation, sometimes even in vacuum chambers or on specialized anti-vibration tables.
- Temperature stability and electromagnetic shielding may also be required to minimize noise and drift, adding further constraints on the experimental setup.
4. Sharp Tip Requirement
- The tip used in STM must be extremely sharp, often terminating in a single atom at the apex. This sharpness is critical because it ensures that the tunneling current is localized and sensitive to the atomic-scale features of the surface. Producing and maintaining such sharp tips is technically challenging and often requires highly controlled tip preparation procedures (e.g., field ion microscopy).
- If the tip is not sharp enough or becomes damaged during scanning, the resolution decreases dramatically, and atomic-scale features can no longer be resolved.
5. Surface Cleanliness and Stability
- STM requires very clean and stable surfaces for reliable measurements. Even minute amounts of contamination, such as dust, adsorbed gases, or water vapor, can affect the tunneling current and lead to inaccurate or blurred images. For this reason, STM experiments are often conducted in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments to ensure that the surface remains pristine during measurements.
- The surface also needs to be stable, meaning that biological samples, which tend to be soft, irregular, or reactive, are not ideal for STM unless prepared in very specific ways. Biological samples also tend to be non-conductive, posing another limitation for their use with STM without special modifications like coating them with conductive materials.


## Electron Microscopes

### How Electron Microscopes Work
Electron microscopes (EMs) use a beam of electrons instead of light to image objects at very high resolutions, often down to the atomic scale. The short wavelength of electrons (compared to photons) allows for much higher resolving power than optical microscopes. There are two main types of electron microscopes: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), both of which work on different principles but share some underlying mechanisms.

#### Basic Operation
1. Electron Source: Electrons are emitted from a heated filament or field emission gun (FEG) and accelerated through a high voltage electric field, typically in the range of 1 kV to $\mathbf{3 0 0} \mathrm{kV}$.
2. Electron Lenses: Magnetic lenses (electromagnets) are used to focus the beam of electrons. These lenses control the path and focus of the electrons, much like how glass lenses focus light in optical microscopes.
3. Interaction with Sample: The electron beam is directed onto the sample, where it interacts with the atoms in the material, producing various signals (such as secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, X-rays, and transmitted electrons) that carry information about the sample's structure, composition, and surface topography.
4. Detection: Detectors collect these signals, which are then processed to form an image or provide analytical information about the sample. In TEM, transmitted electrons are used to generate the image, while in SEM, secondary or backscattered electrons emitted from the surface are used to construct an image.


### Disadvantages of Electron Microscopes (Similarities to STM)
Electron microscopes share several disadvantages with Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STM):
1. Cost:
- Both electron microscopes and STM systems are very expensive due to their complex construction, precise components (e.g., electromagnetic lenses in EM, piezoelectric scanners in STM), and the need for advanced electronics and environmental controls.
2. Fragility:
- EMs, like STMs, are delicate instruments. They require careful maintenance and are prone to damage if mishandled. Components such as the electron gun and lenses must be kept in pristine condition, and the sample must be properly prepared and placed inside the microscope's vacuum chamber.
3. Environmental Control:
- Both EMs and STMs are extremely sensitive to their environment. Vibration, temperature fluctuations, and electromagnetic interference can affect the alignment of the electron beam or tunneling current, degrading image quality.
- Electron microscopes, especially TEM, require high-vacuum environments to ensure that electrons travel unimpeded by air molecules. Additionally, temperature and pressure in the chamber must be tightly controlled to maintain stability and minimize noise.
4. Sample Requirements:
- Like STM, electron microscopes require samples with specific properties. In SEM, samples should ideally be conductive or must be coated with a thin layer of a conductive material (e.g., gold or platinum) to prevent charging from the electron beam. In TEM, samples must be extremely thin (on the order of 10-100 nm ) to allow electrons to pass through.
- Biological samples often need special preparation, such as dehydration or cryo-fixation, as they are not naturally suited for the vacuum environment and electron bombardment.


### Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM is a type of electron microscope that creates high-resolution images of the sample's surface by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons. The key difference between SEM and other electron microscopes (like TEM) is that SEM provides information about surface topography and composition, whereas TEM gives detailed internal structure information.

#### How SEM Works:
1. Electron Beam Scanning: A finely focused beam of high-energy electrons (typically between $1-30 \mathrm{kV}$ ) is raster-scanned across the sample's surface in a vacuum.
2. Interaction with the Surface: As the electrons interact with the atoms on the sample surface, they produce various signals:
- Secondary Electrons: These electrons are ejected from the sample's surface atoms after being hit by the incident electron beam. These low-energy electrons provide information about surface topography and generate high-contrast images.
- Backscattered Electrons: Some electrons from the primary beam are reflected (or "backscattered") from the sample. These high-energy electrons provide compositional information because heavier elements scatter more electrons.
- X-rays: Characteristic X-rays are produced as electrons from inner atomic shells are ejected and replaced by electrons from higher energy levels. The energy of these X-rays is element-specific, enabling elemental composition analysis through Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS).
3. Image Formation: The emitted secondary or backscattered electrons are collected by detectors, and an image is formed by correlating the intensity of the signal with the position of the electron beam on the sample.

#### Advantages of SEM:
- Surface Detail: SEM excels at imaging surface morphology and texture, providing 3D-like images of the sample's surface with high depth of field. It is widely used in materials science, geology, biology, and nanotechnology.
- Composition Analysis: By detecting backscattered electrons and using X-ray analysis, SEM can provide information on the elemental composition of a sample.
- Wide Range of Magnifications: SEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, from low (on the order of tens of times) to very high (over 500,000 times), giving detailed surface information.

#### Limitations of SEM:
- Sample Conductivity: Like STM, SEM works best with conductive materials. Non-conductive samples, such as most biological materials, must be coated with a thin conductive layer (e.g., gold, platinum) to prevent charging by the electron beam.
- Vacuum Requirement: Samples must be placed in a high vacuum, which can damage or alter sensitive materials. Special techniques, such as Environmental SEM (ESEM), allow for imaging in a less stringent vacuum, but resolution may be reduced.
- Sample Preparation: Biological and organic samples need special treatment to survive in the vacuum chamber, including dehydration, freeze-drying, or cryo-immobilization. These treatments can introduce artifacts or alter the natural state of the material.

### Atomic Force Microscopy

#### Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM): How It Works
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique used to map the surface topography of materials with atomic-scale resolution. Unlike electron microscopes, AFM does not rely on electron beams but instead uses a mechanical probe to "feel" the surface of the sample. Here's a detailed explanation of how AFM works:

#### Key Components of AFM:
1. **Cantilever and Tip:**
- AFM uses a cantilever with an extremely sharp tip (typically nanometers wide at the apex) at its end. This tip is brought very close to the sample surface, where forces between the tip and the sample cause the cantilever to deflect.
- The tip is typically made of materials like silicon or silicon nitride, which can provide excellent sharpness and durability.
2. **Detection System:**
- The deflection of the cantilever is measured using a laser beam that is focused on the back of the cantilever. The reflected laser beam hits a position-sensitive photodetector, and any deflection of the cantilever causes a change in the position of the reflected laser spot on the detector.
- This system allows for precise detection of forces acting on the cantilever as the tip interacts with the sample.
3. **Piezoelectric Scanner:**
- The sample (or sometimes the tip) is mounted on a piezoelectric scanner, which moves the sample in three dimensions with sub-nanometer precision. The scanner allows the tip to raster-scan the sample's surface, enabling the AFM to map out the surface topology.
4. **Feedback System:**
- A feedback loop controls the movement of the scanner in the Z direction (vertical) to maintain a constant interaction force between the tip and the sample. This ensures that the tip remains in close proximity to the surface while avoiding direct contact that might damage either the tip or the sample.


#### How AFM Works:
1. Forces Between the Tip and the Sample:

AFM measures various intermolecular forces between the tip and the sample, which can include:
- Van der Waals forces: The weak attractive or repulsive forces between molecules, which dominate at very small distances.
- Electrostatic forces: Arising from any charges present on the surface.
- Capillary forces: These occur when imaging in ambient air due to the thin layer of water on most surfaces.
- Magnetic or chemical interactions: Depending on the tip and sample materials.

The cantilever deflects as the tip experiences these forces, and the degree of deflection is recorded to build up an image of the surface.
2. Modes of Operation:

AFM can operate in several different modes, depending on the nature of the sample and the kind of data needed:
- Contact Mode:
- In contact mode, the tip makes physical contact with the surface as it scans the sample. The forces between the tip and the sample are primarily repulsive.
- As the tip moves across the surface, the deflection of the cantilever is used to map out the surface topography. This mode is very sensitive to surface roughness but can potentially damage soft samples due to the physical contact.
- Tapping Mode (or Intermittent Contact Mode):
- In tapping mode, the cantilever is oscillated at or near its resonant frequency, causing the tip to periodically tap the surface of the sample.
- The tip only intermittently touches the surface, which minimizes damage to soft samples. This mode is widely used for biological samples or delicate nanostructures.
- Non-Contact Mode:
- In non-contact mode, the tip oscillates near the surface without making direct contact. The forces between the tip and the sample are weak attractive van der Waals forces.
- The feedback system adjusts the tip-sample distance to maintain a constant oscillation amplitude. This mode avoids contact but is less sensitive to small changes in topography.
3. Imaging:

As the AFM tip scans across the sample, the cantilever's deflections are recorded by the photodetector and converted into a 3D map of the surface. The feedback system continuously adjusts the height of the cantilever to keep the force between the tip and the sample constant. This adjustment forms the data used to create the topographical image.

AFM is capable of imaging surfaces with sub-nanometer vertical resolution and lateral resolution on the order of 1-10 nm, making it one of the most precise surface imaging techniques available.


Additional Capabilities of AFM:
1. **Force Spectroscopy:**
- In addition to topography, AFM can also measure force-distance curves by moving the tip closer to or farther from the surface. This allows researchers to study the mechanical properties of materials, such as stiffness, adhesion, or elasticity.
2. **Chemical and Functional Imaging:**
- By using specially modified tips, AFM can be used to study the chemical composition of surfaces. For example, functionalized tips can be used to detect specific molecules or chemical groups on a sample surface.
3. **Conductive AFM (C-AFM):**
- In C-AFM, a bias voltage is applied between the tip and the sample, allowing for the measurement of local electrical properties such as conductivity or resistance. This technique is useful for studying semiconductor devices or conductive nanostructures.
4. **Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM):**
- AFM can also be adapted for magnetic force microscopy, where the tip is sensitive to magnetic interactions between the tip and sample. This is useful for imaging the magnetic domains in materials.


#### Advantages of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
### 1. **High Resolution:**
- AFM provides atomic or near-atomic scale resolution for surface imaging. The vertical (Z-axis) resolution can be as fine as 0.1 nm , allowing for the detection of minute changes in surface height. The lateral resolution can range from 1 to 10 nm , depending on the tip sharpness and operating mode. This makes AFM a powerful tool for nanoscale characterization.
### 2. **Versatility:**
- AFM is extremely versatile and can be used to study a wide range of materials, including insulators, semiconductors, and conductors. Unlike electron microscopy techniques (e.g., SEM and TEM), AFM doesn't require the sample to be conductive, which allows for imaging of biological samples, polymers, ceramics, and other non-conductive materials.
### 3. **Multiple Modes of Operation:**
- AFM offers a variety of operational modes such as contact mode, tapping mode, and non-contact mode, each suited for different applications. This flexibility allows researchers to use AFM for imaging, measuring mechanical properties, and studying surface forces or electrical properties.
### 4. **3D Surface Profiling:**
- AFM provides true 3D surface topography as it maps the height of surface features in the Z direction, unlike techniques such as SEM, which mainly give a 2D projection of surface features. This is essential for studying roughness, step heights, and surface texture at the nanoscale.
### 5. Non-Destructive:
- In non-contact or tapping mode, AFM can be relatively non-destructive, making it ideal for imaging delicate samples such as biological specimens, soft polymers, or nanostructures. It avoids the need for high-energy electron beams, which can damage sensitive samples.
### 6. **Ability to Operate in Various Environments:**
- AFM can be operated in air, liquid, or vacuum environments. This is particularly beneficial for studying biological systems or conducting experiments in liquid environments where the sample must remain hydrated, making it a suitable technique for in-situ biological studies.
### 7. **No Special Sample Preparation:**
- Unlike electron microscopy, AFM requires minimal sample preparation. Samples don't need to be coated with conductive layers or placed in a vacuum, allowing for the imaging of samples in their natural state, especially in biological or soft matter research.
### 8. **Multifunctionality:**
- AFM can be used not only for topographic imaging but also for measuring other properties such as mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and chemical properties. For example, using Force Spectroscopy, AFM can probe mechanical stiffness, while Conductive AFM (C-AFM) can measure local electrical conductivity.
### 9. **Force Measurement:**
- AFM enables quantitative force measurements at the nanoscale, including adhesion forces, elasticity, and mechanical resistance. These capabilities are particularly useful in materials science and cell biology to study how surfaces or biological cells react to mechanical forces.
### 10. **No Vacuum Requirement:**
- Unlike electron microscopes (SEM or TEM), AFM does not require samples to be placed in a vacuum chamber, which allows for the examination of samples in ambient conditions or under liquid.
### 11. **Chemical Sensitivity:**
- With functionalized tips, AFM can be used to measure specific chemical interactions between the tip and the sample, allowing for the study of surface chemistry, chemical reactions, or molecular recognition.
### 12. No Vacuum needed: Perfect for bio/organic surfaces

**Measuring Attractive Forces and Force-Distance Curves in AFM**
One of the powerful aspects of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is its ability to measure intermolecular forces such as Van der Waals forces and capillary forces between the tip and the sample. These forces can be quantitatively analyzed by obtaining a force-distance (F-D) curve.

Force-Distance Curves:
A force-distance curve (F-D curve) represents the relationship between the force acting on the AFM tip and the distance between the tip and the sample surface. This curve provides information about various attractive and repulsive forces that act as the tip approaches, touches, and retracts from the surface.

How F-D Curves Are Obtained:
1. Approach Phase:
- As the tip approaches the sample surface, long-range attractive forces (such as Van der Waals forces or electrostatic forces) begin to act. These forces cause the cantilever to deflect towards the surface, and this deflection is measured by the photodetector.
- The attractive forces increase until the tip makes contact with the sample surface, leading to a characteristic downward bend in the F-D curve as the distance decreases.
2. Contact Phase:
- Once the tip contacts the surface, the cantilever experiences repulsive forces due to mechanical resistance from the surface, causing the cantilever to bend in the opposite direction (upward deflection). This is the repulsive contact regime.
3. Retract Phase:
- As the tip is pulled away from the surface, adhesive forces such as capillary forces (due to water or contaminants between the tip and sample) and other attractive forces (like Van der Waals or chemical bonds) can cause the tip to adhere to the surface momentarily.
- Once these forces are overcome, the tip detaches, and the cantilever returns to its equilibrium position, showing a characteristic adhesion peak in the force-distance curve during retraction.

Types of Forces Measured in F-D Curves:
1. Van der Waals Forces:
- These are weak, long-range attractive forces that arise from interactions between induced dipoles in the atoms or molecules of the tip and the sample. Van der Waals forces are most prominent in non-contact AFM modes.
- The attractive portion of the F-D curve during the approach phase represents these forces.
2. Capillary Forces:
- Capillary forces occur due to a thin layer of liquid (often water) on the sample surface in ambient conditions. When the tip contacts the surface, it pulls up this liquid, leading to adhesive forces that are seen in the retract phase of the F-D curve. This force is especially relevant in humid environments and can significantly influence the adhesion behavior.
3. Electrostatic Forces:
- If the sample is charged or the tip-sample system is exposed to an external electric field, electrostatic forces can also be measured. These forces can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the charge polarity.
4. Chemical and Adhesive Forces:
- Specific chemical interactions between the atoms or molecules on the tip and the sample surface can also cause attractive or adhesive forces. For example, functionalized AFM tips can measure specific binding events, like those in molecular recognition or protein-ligand interactions.
5. Elastic and Mechanical Forces:
- The repulsive part of the curve, when the tip is in contact with the surface, allows for the measurement of the mechanical properties of the sample, such as stiffness, Young's modulus, or elasticity.


#### Disadvantages of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
While AFM is a powerful tool with many advantages, it also has some notable disadvantages that can limit its use in certain applications.
### 1. Slower Scanning Speed:
- AFM is generally slower than techniques like Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) because it requires a mechanical tip to physically scan the surface point-by-point. The tip is raster-scanned across the sample, and due to the delicate nature of the interactions, the speed of scanning must be controlled carefully to avoid damaging the tip or sample.
- Time-consuming: High-resolution imaging can take anywhere from minutes to several hours, especially for larger areas or when using high-resolution settings. This makes AFM less suited for rapid imaging, especially when high-throughput is needed.
### 2. Lower Resolution (Compared to STM):
- The lateral resolution of AFM is typically lower than that of STM. While STM can achieve atomic resolution due to the tunneling mechanism being sensitive to electron density at the atomic level, standard AFM's resolution is more limited by the sharpness of the tip and the forces between the tip and the sample.
- Resolution depends on the tip: AFM's resolution is influenced by the tip radius, and typical AFM tips have radii of $5-20 \mathrm{~nm}$. This can result in a lateral resolution that is not as sharp as STM, which has a lateral resolution on the order of sub-nanometers. High-resolution AFMs with extremely sharp tips and optimized systems can achieve similar resolution to STM, but such systems are less common and typically more expensive.
- Vertical (Z-axis) resolution in AFM is generally excellent (on the order of sub-nanometers), but for lateral resolution to be comparable to STM, the tip must be extremely sharp (often terminating in a single atom), which can be difficult to maintain.

### 3. Tip Wear and Contamination:
- The AFM tip is prone to wear and contamination over time, especially when scanning rough or sticky samples. As the tip degrades, the resolution and accuracy of the measurements decrease. This makes it necessary to regularly replace or clean the tips, adding to operational costs and maintenance efforts.
- Tip contamination can also lead to artifacts in the images, particularly when scanning samples with adhesive properties, organic materials, or biological specimens.
### 4. Limited Sample Sizes:
- AFM typically handles small sample areas, often on the scale of tens of micrometers for standard AFM systems. This makes it impractical for imaging large areas or samples with macroscopic dimensions. Additionally, samples must generally fit within the constraints of the AFM setup, which can be a limitation for some experimental designs.
### 5. Surface Requirement:
- AFM works best on smooth, flat surfaces. Irregular or rough surfaces can cause issues with the tip-sample interaction, leading to inaccurate measurements or imaging artifacts.
- If the surface is too rough or sticky, it can cause tip crashes or damage to the cantilever, making it unsuitable for certain types of samples.
### 6. Environmental Sensitivity:
- AFM, like STM, is sensitive to environmental conditions such as vibrations and temperature changes. Even small vibrations from surrounding equipment or air currents can interfere with the mechanical scanning process, degrading image quality.
- Thermal drift over long scanning periods can also affect the accuracy of measurements, requiring precise environmental control to maintain stability during operation.
### 7. Force Sensitivity:
- While AFM is capable of measuring very small forces, in certain modes (such as contact mode), the forces between the tip and the sample can be too strong and damage delicate samples. Biological specimens, soft materials, or thin films can be deformed or scratched by the AFM tip if not handled carefully, limiting its applicability to fragile samples.
### 8. Complex Operation:
- AFM operation requires a high level of technical expertise. Properly tuning the feedback loop, selecting the right operational mode, preparing samples, and maintaining the instrument can be complex and require specialized knowledge. This makes AFM less accessible for routine use without experienced operators.


# Examples of Surfaces

## Aluminum (AI): Properties of Surface Layers and Crystal Structure
Aluminum (AI) is a widely used metal with interesting surface properties that are closely linked to its crystal structure, oxide formation, and the behavior of atoms at its surface compared to the bulk. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the key points:


### Crystal Structure of Aluminum
Aluminum has a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure. In this structure:
- FCC Lattice: Each aluminum atom is surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors, forming a dense, highly coordinated structure.
- The FCC lattice has four close-packed planes: the (111), (100), (110), and (311) planes. These planes are important for understanding surface effects and how atomic spacing changes at the surface of the crystal compared to the bulk.

The high symmetry of the FCC structure contributes to its mechanical and thermal properties, but the behavior at the surface is different from the bulk due to the loss of neighboring atoms.

### Oxide Layers in Aluminum
Aluminum is highly reactive with oxygen, forming a native oxide layer $\left(\mathrm{Al}_2 \mathrm{O}_3\right)$ almost immediately when exposed to air:
- Oxide Layer Characteristics: The aluminum oxide layer is very thin (typically 2-5 nm), but it is highly protective and prevents further oxidation by forming a stable passivation layer. This makes aluminum highly resistant to corrosion.
- Effects of Oxide Layer: The formation of the oxide layer alters the surface properties of aluminum, changing surface energy, mechanical properties, and even atomic spacing at the surface.

### Surface Relaxation and Atom Behavior
At the surface of a crystal, atoms experience a different environment than those in the bulk due to the lack of neighboring atoms on one side. In bulk aluminum, each atom has 12 nearest neighbors, but at the surface, this coordination is reduced, leading to changes in atomic behavior:
- Surface Relaxation: Due to the loss of neighboring atoms, surface atoms tend to adjust their positions. This can lead to expansion or compression of the atomic layers near the surface as they seek to minimize surface energy. This relaxation modifies the lattice spacing in the surface layers.
- Changes in Lattice Spacing: The atoms in the first few layers from the surface may shift closer together or further apart compared to their equilibrium positions in the bulk. The relaxation behavior is highly dependent on the crystal orientation and the atomic arrangement at the surface.

### Percentage Change in Spacing Between Layers:
The percentage change in spacing between atomic layers at the surface is often denoted as $\Delta x y$, where $x$ and $y$ represent adjacent atomic layers. This can be calculated as:

$$
\Delta_{x y}=\frac{\left(d_{x y}-d_{\text {bulk }}\right)}{d_{\text {bulk }}} \times 100
$$

where:
- $d_{x y}$ is the distance between layers $x$ and $y$,
- $d_{\text {bulk }}$ is the spacing between the same layers in the bulk.

### Aluminum Surface Planes and Relaxation Values
1. Al (111) Surface:
- The (111) plane is a close-packed plane in FCC crystals, meaning it is one of the most stable and densely packed surfaces.
- Relaxation of Atomic Layers:
- $\Delta 12=1 \%$ : The spacing between the first and second atomic layers is slightly expanded by about $1 \%$.
- $\Delta \mathbf{2 3}=\mathbf{0 \%}$ : The spacing between the second and third layers is essentially unchanged.
- $\Delta 31=0 \%$ : The third layer remains at the same spacing as the bulk.

This slight expansion of the topmost layer $(\Delta 12=1)$ is typical for the $(111)$ surface, which tends to maintain the stability of the surface.
2. $\mathrm{Al}(110)$ Surface:
- The (110) plane is a less densely packed surface compared to the (111) plane. The atomic arrangement on the (110) surface leads to greater relaxation because atoms are more exposed and experience more significant rearrangement.
- Relaxation of Atomic Layers:
- $\Delta 12=-9 \%$ : The first interlayer spacing is compressed by $9 \%$. This large negative value indicates significant contraction between the first and second layers.
- $\Delta 23$ and $\Delta 31$ : Values for the relaxation of subsequent layers may also show some contraction or slight adjustment, but the most significant change occurs between the first and second layers.

The contraction of the (110) surface is due to the lower coordination of atoms and the relatively open structure compared to the (111) surface.

### Symmetry and Lattice Spacing Changes
- Symmetry Unchanged: Even though the surface atoms undergo relaxation, the overall symmetry of the crystal remains unchanged. For example, the FCC symmetry of the bulk is still preserved, and the periodic arrangement of atoms in the lattice follows the same basic structure as in the bulk.
- Lattice Spacing Changes: The relaxation of the surface layers means that the lattice spacing near the surface is different from that in the bulk. These changes are more pronounced in directions or planes with less atomic packing (like the (110) surface) and less pronounced in close-packed planes (like (111)).

### Summary of Surface Relaxation for Aluminum
- Aluminum (111): Slight expansion of the first interlayer distance $(\Delta 12=1)$ and no significant change in subsequent layers. This is a stable, close-packed surface.
- Aluminum (110): Significant contraction of the first interlayer spacing ( $\Delta 12=-9$, reflecting the open structure and greater tendency for surface atoms to relax.
- The symmetry of the FCC lattice remains unchanged, but lattice spacing changes near the surface due to the different atomic environments compared to the bulk.

Surface relaxation is an important factor in understanding the surface energy, reactivity, and mechanical properties of aluminum and other metals, especially for applications in thin films, nanostructures, and surface treatments.


## Platinum and Catalytic Activity: Surface Structure and Local Environments

Platinum ( Pt ) is a widely used material in catalysis, especially for reactions like hydrogenation, oxidation, and in fuel cells. The catalytic activity of platinum is highly dependent on the surface structure and local environment, as changes in these factors can significantly alter the reactivity of the platinum surface. Here's a detailed explanation of how local environments and surface structures affect platinum's catalytic activity.


### Surface Structure of Platinum
Platinum, like many metals, has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The catalytic properties of platinum depend heavily on the crystallographic orientation of the exposed surface, which determines how atoms are arranged on the surface and how they interact with adsorbates (e.g., reactant molecules like $\mathrm{CO}, \mathrm{O}_2$, etc.).

Key Platinum Surfaces:
- Pt(111): A close-packed surface with high stability. The atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, and it is often less reactive due to its compact structure, which minimizes available surface atoms for interaction.
- $\operatorname{Pt}(100)$ : This surface has a square arrangement of atoms in its natural state, which is more open and thus typically more reactive than $\mathrm{Pt}(111)$. However, the structure can rearrange under certain conditions (e.g., in the presence of gases like carbon monoxide).
- $\operatorname{Pt}(110)$ : This is a more open surface, with atoms less densely packed. It is highly reactive due to the presence of more exposed atoms with unsatisfied bonds.

The orientation and atomic arrangement of these surfaces play a crucial role in determining how well the surface can adsorb and activate molecules, which is critical for catalytic reactions.


### Surface Restructuring of Platinum
The local environment-including gases or reactants adsorbed on the surface-can cause platinum's surface structure to rearrange. This restructuring happens because the surface atoms adjust their positions to minimize the free energy of the system under the influence of the surrounding environment.
#### 1. Restructuring of $\operatorname{Pt}(100)$ : Hexagonal Pattern Formation
- **Surface Changes Under Vacuum:** In vacuum or inert environments, the Pt(100) surface may naturally transition from a square arrangement to a hexagonal pattern. This occurs because the hexagonal arrangement can lower the surface free energy, making it a more energetically favorable structure.
- The hexagonal pattern is similar to what is seen on the close-packed $\mathrm{Pt}(111)$ surface, which is more stable due to its dense packing and lower surface energy.
- **Effect of Gas Exposure (e.g., CO):** When exposed to gases like carbon monoxide (CO), the $\mathrm{Pt}(100)$ surface can undergo further restructuring. CO binds strongly to the platinum surface and can induce significant rearrangements in surface atoms:
- Cubic to Hexagonal Transition: In the presence of CO , the $\mathrm{Pt}(100)$ surface, which is cubic, may transition to a hexagonal arrangement. This restructuring is driven by the desire to minimize the adsorption energy of CO on the surface, which leads to a more stable configuration that favors hexagonal patterns.

#### 2. Influence of Cutting Direction on Surface Structure

The crystal orientation and the direction in which the platinum is cut also play a critical role in determining the surface structure:
- **Cut in Vacuum:** When platinum is cut in vacuum or exposed to inert environments, the surface tends to relax and adopt the lowest energy configuration. For the $\operatorname{Pt}(100)$ surface, this may involve the transformation to a hexagonal structure to minimize surface energy.
- **Exposure to Carbon Monoxide (CO):** As mentioned, if the same surface (e.g., $\mathrm{Pt}(100)$ ) is exposed to CO, it favors a hexagonal structure. CO binds preferentially to certain surface sites (like atop or bridge sites), and the surface atoms may rearrange to accommodate CO adsorption. This leads to changes in surface reactivity, making it more effective for specific catalytic processes such as CO oxidation.
- **Exposure to Carbon Dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_2\right)$ :** The surface interaction with carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_2\right)$ is different from that with $\mathrm{CO} . \mathrm{CO}_2$ has weaker adsorption to platinum surfaces compared to CO , and it may not induce the same degree of surface restructuring. However, $\mathrm{CO}_2$ can still affect surface activity through adsorption or reaction intermediates, but the structural transformation is typically less dramatic than in the case of CO .

The restructuring of the platinum surface is thus environment-dependent, and the adsorbate (such as CO or $\mathrm{CO}_2$ ) can significantly alter the surface arrangement.


### Catalytic Activity and Platinum Surface Structure
Platinum's catalytic activity is directly linked to the availability of active sites on its surface. Changes in the surface structure due to local environmental factors (e.g., gas exposure) can increase or decrease the number of active sites available for catalytic reactions.
1. **$\operatorname{Pt}(100)$ Hexagonal Structure:**
- When $\mathrm{Pt}(100)$ adopts a hexagonal pattern, its surface becomes more similar to $\mathrm{Pt}(111)$, which may reduce its reactivity compared to the open cubic surface. However, for certain reactions like CO oxidation, this hexagonal arrangement can be beneficial, as it may enhance the adsorption and reaction pathways for CO .
2. **Surface Energy Minimization:**
- The restructuring of platinum surfaces in the presence of different gases is largely driven by the need to minimize surface energy. For example, CO binds strongly to platinum and induces surface rearrangement to maximize binding efficiency. This restructuring also modifies the electronic properties of the surface, which can either enhance or reduce its catalytic efficiency depending on the reaction.
3. **Symmetry and Catalytic Behavior:**
- Despite the structural rearrangements, the symmetry of the platinum crystal (FCC) remains unchanged at the bulk level, but the lattice spacing and surface atomic arrangement can be significantly altered. These changes affect how reactants bind to the surface and how easily they can be activated, influencing the overall catalytic behavior.
