## GISAXS (Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering)


- With a 2D image plate applying an incident beam with a glancing angle of 0.20 deg.
- GISAXS Pattern
- You get scattering vector intensities (not locations of atoms), and then you calculate the structure from that. So this is not a direct measurement of locations of atoms.
