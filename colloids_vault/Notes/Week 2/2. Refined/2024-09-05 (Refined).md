# Surface Energy vs Surface Tension


##### What is surface energy?
is the energy required to create a unit area of surface. 

##### What gives rise to surface energy?
It arises because molecules at the surface of a material (liquid or solid) experience different forces compared to those in the bulk. 
- For liquids, molecules inside a liquid are surrounded by others and interact equally in all directions, while molecules at the surface interact less with neighboring molecules, creating an imbalance. This imbalance results in the system costing energy to maintain the surface.
- For solids,

##### What are the units of surface energy?
Surface energy is expressed in units of energy per unit area: $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{m}^2$ (or equivalently $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}$, as energy is force times distance).


##### Imagine you have a droplet of liquid with a surface energy $\gamma$ of $0.072 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^2$ (which is typical for water at room temperature). Calculate the surface energy required to create a spherical droplet with a radius of $r=1 \mathrm{~mm}=0.001 \mathrm{~m}$.

1. Surface Area of the Droplet: The surface area $A$ of a sphere is given by the formula:

$$
A=4 \pi r^2
$$


For a droplet with a radius of $r=0.001 \mathrm{~m}$ :

$$
A=4 \pi(0.001)^2=4 \pi \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^2=1.2566 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^2
$$

2. Surface Energy: The surface energy $E$ is calculated by multiplying the surface energy per unit area $\gamma$ by the total surface area $A$ :

$$
E=\gamma \times A
$$


Given $\gamma=0.072 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^2$ and $A=1.2566 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^2$ :

$$
E=0.072 \times 1.2566 \times 10^{-5}=9.048 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~J}
$$



##### What is surface tension?
It is the force per unit length that acts along the surface, trying to minimize it. It can be thought of as the surface's "resistance" to deformation or stretching.

##### What does surface tension occur in liquids?
==this answer does not really answer the question==
it occurs because the liquid surface behaves like a stretched elastic membrane


##### What leads to phenomena like spherical droplets?
Surface tension aims to minimize the surface area, leading to phenomena like spherical droplets.


##### What are the units of surface tension?
Surface tension is measured in force per unit length: $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}$.


###### You have a thin water film stretched across a rectangular wire frame. The length of the wire is $L=0.1 \mathrm{~m}(10 \mathrm{~cm})$, and the surface tension of water at room temperature is $\gamma=$ $0.072 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$. Calculate the force due to surface tension.

Surface tension $\gamma$ creates a force that acts along the edge of the liquid surface. Since the water film has two surfaces (front and back), the total length over which surface tension acts is twice the length of the wire frame ==is this correct?==:

$$
\text { Total Length }=2 L=2 \times 0.1=0.2 \mathrm{~m}
$$


The force due to surface tension $F$ is given by:

$$
F=\gamma \times \text { Total Length }
$$


Substituting the values:

$$
F=0.072 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m} \times 0.2 \mathrm{~m}=0.0144 \mathrm{~N}
$$






## Surface Energy ( $\psi$ ) and When It's Positive or Negative


##### The surface energy ( $v$ ) of an interface is typically positive, meaning that 
- [ ] energy is required to maintain the surface
- [ ] energy is not required to maintain the surface

==What does this mean?==
This is because most systems want to reduce the interface to minimize energy. 

##### What happens when a system has negative surface energy, and what are some examples?
When a system has negative surface energy, it means that the formation of additional surface area lowers the system's overall energy, leading to a spontaneous tendency for the surface to expand. This is an unusual situation, as most systems have positive surface energy, meaning it costs energy to create a surface or interface due to the breaking of bonds or the exposure of higher energy atoms or molecules at the surface.


###### You have a system of two components, A and B. If the surface area of the interface between A and B tends to a minimum, without the input of energy, then we can say that
the surface energy between A and B is positive



###### If an an interface has a positive surface energy, it means that
- [x] the creation of a new interface requires energy
- [ ] the creation of a new interface does not energy

###### In the absence of surfactants, the surface energy between immiscible fluids like oil and water
- [x] is typically positive, meaning that the creation of a new interface (e.g., by dispersing oil droplets in water) requires energy.
- [ ] is typically negative, meaning that the creation of a new interface (e.g., by dispersing oil droplets in water) requires energy.

###### You have a system consisting of an aqueous and organic phase. Are the following assumptions correct?
- [ ] The total surface energy of the oil-water interfaces in the emulsion is less than the surface energy of the oil-water interface in the phase-separated system.

###### When surfactants are introduced into a system consisting of two immiscible fluids
- [x] they reduce the positive surface energy by positioning themselves at the oil-water interface.
- [ ] they reduce the increase surface energy by positioning themselves at the oil-water interface.
- [ ] they completely negate the energy cost of maintaining the interface
- [x] they don't completely negate the energy cost of maintaining the interface
- [ ] they reduce the positive surface energy by forming micelles.
- [ ] they increase the positive surface energy by forming micelles.


###### In systems with positive surface energy
- [x] emulsions are typically stable but rely on the surfactant to prevent phase separation.
- [ ] emulsions are typically stable and don't rely on the surfactant to prevent phase separation.
- [x] droplets remain distinct
- [ ] droplets tend to coalesce
- [x] the system spontaneously increases in surface area
- [ ] the system spontaneously decreases in surface area


###### Select the true statements
- [x] At high enough concentrations, surfactants can reduce the surface energy so much that it becomes negative.
- [ ] At high enough concentrations, surfactants can increase the surface energy so much that it becomes positive.
- [x] At high enough surfactant concentrations, creating additional surface area between the immiscible phases lowers the system’s overall energy.
- [ ] At high enough surfactant concentrations, creating additional surface area between the immiscible phases increases the system’s overall energy.


##### What is spontaneous emulsification?
The formation of an emulsion between two immiscible fluids without the need for energy input (like stirring or shaking)

##### Why does an emulsion of immiscible fluids tend to phase-separate? 
When two immiscible fluids, like oil and water, are mixed, they form an interface between them due to their inability to mix at a molecular level. This interface has a positive surface energy (denoted as $\gamma$ ), meaning that creating and maintaining the interface requires energy. The system naturally seeks to minimize its total energy, and one way to do this is by reducing the surface area of the interface.

**Why Phase Separation Occurs:**
1. Surface Energy Minimization: The surface energy $\gamma$ is always positive, so the system prefers to minimize the surface area between the two immiscible fluids to lower the total energy. The most efficient way to do this is through phase separation, where the two fluids segregate into distinct layers, reducing the interface between them.
2. Droplet Formation: Initially, if one fluid is dispersed as droplets in the other, the droplets tend to take on a spherical shape because a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume. This minimizes the surface energy for each droplet.
3. Coalescence: Over time, if the system is left undisturbed, the droplets will merge, or coalesce, forming larger droplets or separating entirely into two distinct layers. This process further reduces the surface area and thus decreases the overall surface energy, driving the system towards complete phase separation.


##### What creates tension in the case of an air-water interface?
the water molecules are hydrogen-bonded in the bulk but have fewer bonds at the surface, creating a tension.

##### Why does water form droplets when placed on a surface?
the system wants to minimize the number of molecules at the interface


##### You're given a cube of silicon with dimensions $1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}$. The density of silicon is given as $2.4 \frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm^3}}$. Calculate the total mass of the impurity in the cube if the total mass of the impurity as 1 part per million (ppm).
overview: Calculate the total mass of the cube by multiplying the density by the volume. Calculate the mass of the impurity by multiplying the impurity concentration by the total mass of the cube. Calculate the surface area of the cube.


1. Cube's Total Mass Calculation:

You're given a cube of silicon with dimensions $1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}$, which means the volume $V$ of the cube is:

$$
V=1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}=1 \mathrm{~cm}^3
$$


The density of silicon is given as $2.4 \frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3}$, so the mass $m$ of the silicon cube is:

$$
m=\text { Density } \times \text { Volume }=2.4 \frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}^3=2.4 \mathrm{~g}
$$


This tells us that the mass of the cube is 2.4 g .
2. Amount of Impurity at 1 ppm :

At a concentration of 1 part per million (ppm), the amount of impurity in the cube is a fraction of the cube's total mass:

$$
\text { Impurity mass }=\frac{1}{10^6} \times \text { Total mass }=\frac{1}{10^6} \times 2.4 \mathrm{~g}=2.4 \mu \mathrm{g}
$$


This means that the amount of impurity in the entire cube is $2.4 \mu \mathrm{g}$.

##### You're given a cube of silicon with dimensions $1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}$. The density of silicon is given as $2.4 \frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm^3}}$. The impurity concentration on the surface is $0.1 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^2$. How much impurity would be required to fully coat the cube's surface?


The surface area $A$ of a cube with side length 1 cm is calculated as:

$$
A=6 \times(\text { side length })^2=6 \times(1 \mathrm{~cm})^2=6 \mathrm{~cm}^2
$$


So, the cube has a total surface area of $6 \mathrm{~cm}^2$. The impurity concentration on the surface is $0.1 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^2$. To coat the entire surface of the cube (which has an area of $6 \mathrm{~cm}^2$ ) with this impurity concentration, the total amount of impurity required is:

Impurity for full coating $=$ Concentration $\times$ Surface area $=0.1 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^2 \times 6 \mathrm{~cm}^2=0.6 \mu \mathrm{g}$

So, to fully coat the cube's surface with impurities, you would need $0.6 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of impurity.



###### (==I am confused about the following==) For catalytic reactions, maximizing the surface area of the catalyst (often in powder form) is critical because reactions occur at the surface. A higher surface energy $(\mathrm{V}$ ) can drive reactions but also requires stabilization strategies (e.g., using porous structures or supports to prevent the catalyst from minimizing its surface area and losing reactivity).






Why Does Interfacial Tension Cost Energy?
Interfacial tension (or surface energy) costs energy due to the imbalance of molecular forces at the interface. For example:
- Air-Water Interface: In the bulk of the liquid, water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other. At the surface, however, water molecules lack sufficient bonding partners, creating an energetic imbalance. This imbalance results in surface tension, as the system attempts to minimize its energy by reducing the surface area.

==Interfacial tension can create impurities==
- Solid Impurities: In the case of a silicon cube, the introduction of impurities to the surface disrupts the regular atomic lattice. The disruption changes the bonding at the surface, costing energy. As shown in your example, even very small amounts of impurity can cover large surface areas due to the thin layer they form.


# Surface Roughness

- **Apparent area vs actual area:** For a solid surface, usually the surface area is much larger on the nanometer scale due to surface roughness
	- Why are solid interfaces not perfectly smooth like interfaces? 
		- The molecules in a solid are much less mobile compared to those in a liquid
		- The other reason has to do with energy and entropy: 
	- Examples: 
		- **Porous Surfaces:** Asphault and concrete are both porous surfaces, but on a different length scale (as evidenced by the difference in how quickly each surface will absorb water)
		- **Materials with Internal Surfaces:** For example, crystals have grain boundaries.
- **How do we measure surface roughness?**
	- Atomic Force Microscopy
	- CryoEM
	- Liquid Phase TM
	- Microscope
- **How do we quantify surface roughness?**



This gives you the average between the peak and valley values.

$$
R_a=\frac{1}{l_r} \int_0^{l_r}|z(x)| d x=\sqrt{\frac{1}{l_r} \int_0^{l_r}(z(x))^2 d x}
$$

- You could also measure the difference between peaks, but this wont be as averaged as $R_a$

==Check Notes==: The value from calculating the integral in both of the surfaces will be the same. So we need to have a measure of skewness to differentiate between the two different cases.



$$
R_{s k}=\frac{1}{R_a^3}\left[\frac{1}{l_r} \int_0^{l_r}(z(x))^3 d x\right]
$$


- Lotus leaves are an example of a surface that are extremely hydrophobic. If we have a surface that is extremely rough and has many nanometer sized bumps, then when water comes into contact with the surface, it is only able to come into contact with the peaks of the material on the surface. The valleys of the material remains free of water. In this scenario, you will get contact angles that are very large. Surface roughness, and chemistry combined are what can make a material super hydrophobic.
- If we have two smooth surfaces in contact with one another, then we can make the assumption that the have the full area in contact. If the surfaces are extremely rough, then we can assume that they make very little contact with one another.
- Contacting Surface Area: The total area over which two surfaces make contact with one another



**Where does surface roughness come from?**\

==See notes for sketch==
- Entropy: If we have one plane growing, there is only one possible arrangement for the configuration shown. For the second configuration, there are more microstates.
