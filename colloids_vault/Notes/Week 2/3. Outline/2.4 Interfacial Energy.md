## 0.1 Why Do Interfaces Form?

### 0.1.1 Thermodynamic Perspective on Interface Stability

- **Why do interfaces form according to thermodynamics?** In thermodynamics, interfaces form because systems tend to minimize their free energy. 
- **What does the interface between two phases such as a liquid and vapor or solid and liquid represent?** The interface between two phases, such as liquid and vapor or solid and liquid, represents a region where the properties change from those characteristic of one phase to those of the other. 
- **The stability of an interface arises because it represents a compromise between two competing effects. List these two effects.**
	- Minimization of Bulk Free Energy
	- Cost of Interface Formation (Surface Energy)
	- _Minimization of Bulk Free Energy:_ **How does a system tend to minimize its bulk free energy?** The system tends to minimize its bulk free energy by separating into distinct phases. 
		- _Example for oil and water:_ **How does a mixture of oil and water reduce its overall energy?** For example, in a mixture of oil and water, the system reduces its overall energy by minimizing the overlap between oil and water molecules, leading to phase separation.
	- _Cost of Interface Formation (Surface Energy):_ **Why does creating an interface cost energy?** Creating an interface costs energy because the molecules at the interface have fewer neighboring molecules of the same type, leading to higher energy states. 
		- **What is surface energy a measure of?** This surface energy is a measure of the energetic cost of having an interface
		- **Why is surface energy typically greater than the bulk?** it is typically greater than the bulk energy because the molecules at the surface are not as fully bonded as those in the bulk.
	- **What is the stability of an interface determined by?** The stability of an interface is determined by 
		- 1. the balance between the reduction in bulk free energy and 
		- 2. the increase in surface energy. 
	- **Considering bulk energy and surface energy, under what condition is an interface stable?** If the gain in bulk free energy from phase separation is greater than the cost of creating an interface ($\Delta E_b > E_s$) , the interface will be stable. Otherwise, the system may try to minimize the interfacial area, as seen in phenomena like droplet coalescence.


- **Why is the energy associated with the surface of a material (surface energy) is generally higher than the energy of the bulk material?** This difference arises because atoms or molecules at the surface experience different bonding environments than those in the bulk. In the bulk, each atom is surrounded by other atoms, leading to a stable, lower-energy configuration. At the surface, however, atoms have fewer neighbors, resulting in unbalanced forces and higher energy. 
- **Why do droplets of liquid tend to coalesce over time?** When small droplets combine to form a larger droplet, the total surface area decreases, thereby reducing the system's overall surface energy. The tendency to minimize surface energy is a driving force for the coalescence of droplets.

2. **Helmholtz Free Energy $(F)$ :** Defined as $F=U-T S$, where $U$ is the internal energy, $T$ is the temperature, and $S$ is the entropy of the system. Helmholtz free energy is used for processes occurring at constant volume and temperature.

Free energy represents the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system, excluding work done by pressure and volume changes. It is a key concept in determining the spontaneity of chemical reactions and phase transitions.

#### 0.1.3.2 Why Do Small Droplets Combine to Form Larger Droplets?
Small droplets combine to form larger droplets because this process minimizes the system's surface energy. For a fixed volume, the surface energy is directly proportional to the surface area of the droplet. Larger droplets have a smaller surface area relative to their volume compared to smaller droplets, which means they have lower surface energy for the same volume.


Volume to Surface Area Ratio for a Sphere
#### 0.1.3.3 Why do droplets tend to form spherical shapes? Show that a sphere is more energetically favorable that a cube in terms of surface energy.

Why do larger droplets have a lower surface energy per unit volume compared to smaller droplets?




**Surface area ratio of a sphere:**
The relationship between volume and surface area for a sphere is fundamental in understanding why droplets coalesce. For a sphere with radius $r$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{\text {sphere }} & =\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \\
A_{\text {sphere }} & =4 \pi r^2
\end{aligned}
$$


The ratio of volume to surface area for a sphere is:

$$
\frac{V}{A}=\frac{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{4 \pi r^2}=\frac{r}{3}
$$


This shows that as the radius $r$ increases, the volume-to-surface-area ratio increases, meaning that larger spheres (droplets) have a smaller surface area relative to their volume.

This ratio $\frac{V}{A}$ increases as the radius $r$ increases, indicating that larger spheres have a smaller surface area relative to their volume. This is why larger droplets have lower surface energy per unit volume compared to smaller droplets.


**Comparison with a Cube**

For comparison, consider a cube with side length $a$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
V_{\text {cube }}=a^3 \\
A_{\text {cube }}=6 a^2
\end{gathered}
$$


The ratio of volume to surface area for a cube is:

$$
\frac{V}{A}=\frac{a^3}{6 a^2}=\frac{a}{6}
$$


While the cube has a different geometry than the sphere, the same principle applies: as the characteristic length (side length $a$ for the cube or radius $r$ for the sphere) increases, the volumeto-surface-area ratio increases, which in turn reduces the surface energy.


**Takeaway:**
Comparing the surface area ratios:
- For a sphere: $\frac{V}{A}=\frac{r}{3}$
- For a cube: $\frac{V}{A}=\frac{a}{6}$

If we consider a sphere and a cube with the same characteristic length (i.e., $r=a$ ), the sphere has a higher volume-to-surface-area ratio:

$$
\frac{V_{\text {sphere }}}{A_{\text {sphere }}}=\frac{r}{3}, \quad \frac{V_{\text {cube }}}{A_{\text {cube }}}=\frac{a}{6}=\frac{r}{6}
$$


This comparison shows that for the same characteristic length, a sphere has a lower surface area relative to its volume than a cube. As a result, the sphere is energetically more favorable in terms of surface energy because it has less surface area to maintain, which is why droplets tend to form spherical shapes to minimize surface tension.

## 0.3 Supercooling

- What is supercooling? Supercooling refers to the process of cooling a liquid below its thermodynamic freezing point without it becoming solid. 
- In a supercooled state, the liquid remains in a metastable phase because the nucleation barrier prevents the formation of a solid phase, even though the thermodynamically stable phase at that temperature is a solid.
- Why does supercooling occur? Supercooling occurs because, below the freezing point, the liquid's molecules do not spontaneously arrange themselves into a solid crystalline structure due to the nucleation barrier. 
- As the temperature decreases further, the likelihood of spontaneous nucleation increases because thermal fluctuations become less capable of overcoming the barrier. 
- Supercooling is commonly observed in pure liquids, where the absence of impurities or nucleation sites makes it difficult for solid nuclei to form.

## 0.4 Critical Radius ($r_c$)

- Critical radius $\left(r_c\right)$ is the minimum radius of a nucleus (such as a crystal or droplet) at which it becomes thermodynamically stable and can continue to grow. 
- If a nucleus is smaller than the critical radius, it will tend to dissolve or shrink because the surface energy cost is too high relative to the bulk free energy gain. 
- Conversely, if the nucleus reaches or exceeds the critical radius, it becomes energetically favorable for it to grow, leading to the formation of the new phase.


The critical radius is derived from the balance between the decrease in bulk free energy and the increase in surface energy:

$$
\Delta G_{\text {total }}=\text { Surface Energy }+ \text { Bulk Free Energy }
$$


The critical radius $r_c$ is found by setting the derivative of the total free energy with respect to the radius equal to zero (i.e., finding the maximum of the nucleation barrier). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \gamma}{\Delta G_v}
$$

where:
- $\gamma$ is the surface tension or surface energy per unit area,
- $\Delta G_v$ is the difference in bulk free energy per unit volume between the two phases.

The critical radius $r_c$ determines the size at which a nucleus can overcome the nucleation barrier and lead to the growth of a new phase, such as solidification in supercooled liquids or droplet formation in supersaturated vapors.

Question 18: Applications of Critical Radius in Phase Transitions
18. In which of the following situations does the concept of critical radius $r_c$ apply?
- A. Solidification in supercooled liquids
- B. Droplet formation in supersaturated vapors
- C. Crystal formation in a supersaturated solution
- D. All of the above

Answer: D

Question 19: A supercooled liquid is undergoing nucleation to form a solid phase. The surface tension between the liquid and the solid phase is $0.15 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^2$. The bulk free energy difference between the liquid and solid phases at the given temperature is $2.5 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^3$. Calculate the critical radius $r_c$ of the nucleus at which it becomes thermodynamically stable and can grow.

The student should recall that the critical radius is given by:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \gamma}{\Delta G_v}
$$


Plugging in the values:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \times 0.15}{2.5 \times 10^6}=\frac{0.3}{2.5 \times 10^6}=1.2 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}
$$


Thus, the critical radius $r_c$ is $1.2 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}$ or 120 nm .


## 0.5 Stability of Solids

- Solid objects don't spontaneously fall apart because of the stability provided by the atomic and molecular interactions within the solid. -
- These interactions, typically in the form of chemical bonds or intermolecular forces, create a stable structure where atoms or molecules are arranged in a specific pattern or lattice that minimizes the system's overall energy. 
- The energy required to break these bonds and disrupt the solid structure (to cause it to "fall apart") is significant, and such processes are thermodynamically unfavorable under normal conditions.
- For a solid object to disintegrate spontaneously, there would need to be a sufficient amount of energy to overcome the cohesive forces holding the atoms or molecules together. However, in most cases, the energy available from the environment is not enough to break these bonds, leading to the stability of solids over time. 
- This stability is also why solids tend to maintain their shape and resist deformation unless acted upon by an external force.

    - C. By continuously exchanging energy with the environment
    - D. By increasing the internal temperature of the solid  

    **Answer:** B

### Question 21: Energy Required for Disintegration
21. **What must happen for a solid object to disintegrate spontaneously?**
    - A. The atoms or molecules must become stationary
    - B. A sufficient amount of energy must be available to overcome cohesive forces
    - C. The temperature must decrease to freeze the structure in place
    - D. External forces must compress the solid  

    **Answer:** B

### Question 22: Environmental Energy and Solid Stability

## 0.6 Nucleation Barrier and Its Role in Surface Energy

### 0.6.1 Nucleation Barrier
- **Which concept explains why:** The nucleation barrier is a concept that explains why new phases (like ice forming in water) do not occur spontaneously, even when conditions are favorable for the phase transition. 
- It represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for a new phase (such as a crystal or droplet) to form and grow.
- When a new phase begins to form, such as a crystal nucleus in a supercooled liquid, there is a competition between the decrease in bulk free energy (which drives the phase transition) and the increase in surface energy (which opposes it). 
- The surface energy is proportional to the area of the interface between the new and old phases, while the bulk free energy change is proportional to the volume of the new phase.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
- Positive Surface Energy Contribution: The surface energy increases with the square of the radius $r$ of the nucleus (since surface area scales with $r^2$ ).
- Negative Bulk Energy Contribution: The bulk free energy decreases with the cube of the radius $r$ (since volume scales with $r^3$ ).

The total free energy change $\Delta G$ as a function of the radius $r$ of the nucleus is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta G(r)=\text { Surface Energy Contribution - Bulk Free Energy Contribution } \\
& \qquad \Delta G(r)=\gamma r^2-\Delta G_v r^3
\end{aligned}
$$


Where:
- $\gamma$ is the surface tension or surface energy per unit area,
- $\Delta G_v$ is the difference in bulk free energy per unit volume between the new and old phases.

- C. Both surface energy and bulk free energy remain equal regardless of $r$

Answer: A

---


In a supercooled liquid, a nucleus of a new solid phase begins to form. The total free energy change associated with forming this nucleus of radius $r$ is $3 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^3$ and the surface tension is $0.12 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^2$. Calculate the radius for the minimum total free energy change.

A. 13.3 nm
B. 26.7 nm
C. 33.3 nm
D. 40.0 nm


1. Set Up the Equation for the Critical Radius

To find the critical radius $r_{\mathrm{c},}$, we set the derivative of $\Delta G(r)$ with respect to $r$ equal to zero, as this corresponds to the maximum of $\Delta G(r)$ :

$$
\frac{d}{d r} \Delta G(r)=0
$$


Given:

$$
\Delta G(r)=\gamma r^2-\Delta G_v r^3
$$


We differentiate $\Delta G(r)$ with respect to $r$ :

$$
\frac{d}{d r} \Delta G(r)=2 \gamma r-3 \Delta G_v r^2
$$


Set this equal to zero:

$$
2 \gamma r-3 \Delta G_v r^2=0
$$

2. Solve for $r$

Factor out $r$ :

$$
r\left(2 \gamma-3 \Delta G_v r\right)=0
$$


This gives two solutions:
- $r=0$, which is not relevant as it represents no nucleus.
- $2 \gamma-3 \Delta G_v r=0$.

Solve for $r$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
3 \Delta G_v r=2 \gamma \\
r=\frac{2 \gamma}{3 \Delta G_v}
\end{gathered}
$$


Thus, the critical radius $r_c$ is:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \gamma}{3 \Delta G_v}
$$

3. Calculate the Critical Radius

Substitute the given values of $\gamma$ and $\Delta G_v$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
r_c=\frac{2 \times 0.12}{3 \times 3 \times 10^6} \\
r_c=\frac{0.24}{9 \times 10^6} \\
r_c=2.67 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~m}
\end{gathered}
$$


Converting to nanometers ( $\left.1 \mathrm{~m}=10^9 \mathrm{~nm}\right)$ :

$$
r_c=26.7 \mathrm{~nm}
$$





### 0.6.2 Why Do We See a Peak in the Energy Landscape?

- The energy landscape as a function of the nucleus radius $r$ shows a peak at a certain critical radius $r_c$. 
- At radii smaller than $r_c$, the positive surface energy dominates, and the total free energy $\Delta G(r)$ increases with increasing $r$. 
- This means that small nuclei are unstable and tend to dissolve because it is energetically unfavorable for them to grow. 
- However, once the nucleus reaches the critical radius $r_c$, the negative bulk free energy term becomes dominant, and the total free energy $\Delta G(r)$ begins to decrease with increasing $r$, making the growth of the nucleus energetically favorable.

The critical radius $r_c$ can be found by setting the derivative of $\Delta G(r)$ with respect to $r$ equal to zero:

$$
\frac{d \Delta G(r)}{d r}=2 \gamma r-3 \Delta G_v r^2=0
$$


Solving for $r$ gives the critical radius:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \gamma}{\Delta G_v}
$$


Once a nucleus reaches this critical size, it will continue to grow, leading to the formation of a new phase throughout the system.

Calculate the critical radius $r_{\mathrm{c}}$ at which the nucleus becomes stable and will continue to grow.
A) 0.005 m
B) 0.01 m
C) 0.02 m

Solution:

Given:
- Surface energy per unit area, $\gamma=0.1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^2$
- Negative volume free energy change per unit volume, $\Delta G_v=-10 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^3$

First, take the absolute value of $\Delta G_v$ since it's negative:

$$


Now, use the formula for the critical radius:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \gamma}{\left|\Delta G_v\right|}=\frac{2 \times 0.1}{10}=\frac{0.2}{10}=0.02 \mathrm{~m}
$$

## 0.7 Work of Cohesion and Work of Adhesion

- When you have a material composed of two different substances bonded together, the boundary between them is called an interface. 
- This interface is a region where the properties of one material transition to the properties of the other. 
- The interface's characteristics, such as its energy, determine how easily the two materials can be separated or bonded.

- **Work of Adhesion:** When two different materials are bonded together, the energy required to split them apart to form two separate surfaces is known as the work of adhesion. 
	- This process involves breaking the bonds at the interface and creating new surfaces for each material. 
	- The work of adhesion is a measure of the strength of the interaction between the two different materials at the interface.
- **Work of Cohesion:** When a material is made of the same substance throughout, the energy required to split it apart is known as the work of cohesion. 
	- In this case, the same material bonds need to be broken on either side of the interface. 
	- The work of cohesion is related to the intrinsic bonding strength within the material itself.


Surface Energy $(\gamma)$
- Surface energy is a critical concept in understanding splitting surfaces. It represents the amount of energy required to create a unit area of surface. 
- Mathematically, surface energy is defined as:

$$
\gamma=\frac{\text { Energy required to create a surface }}{\text { Area of the surface created }}
$$

- Units: Surface energy is typically measured in energy per unit area (e.g., joules per square meter, $J / m^2$ ).
- When a material is split, new surfaces are created, and the energy associated with these surfaces is proportional to their surface energy.
- For two surfaces of the same material:

$$
W_{\|}=2 \cdot \gamma_s
$$
- Here, $W_{\|}$is the work required to split the material into two surfaces, and $\gamma_s$ is the surface energy of the material.



**Reversibility in Liquids vs. Solids**
- Liquids: In most liquids, the process of splitting and rejoining surfaces is reversible. 
	- This reversibility occurs because liquid molecules are not as rigidly bonded as those in solids, allowing them to flow and reattach with relative ease. 
	- The molecular mobility in liquids enables them to reform bonds and minimize the surface energy, effectively "healing" the split surfaces.
- Solids: In contrast, the process is typically irreversible in solids. This irreversibility arises from two main factors:
	1. Bond Strength: In solids, atoms or molecules are held together by strong, rigid bonds. When a solid is split, these bonds are broken, and re-forming them exactly as they were is extremely difficult. Unlike liquids, where molecules can easily move and reconfigure, the fixed positions of atoms in a solid make it challenging to reestablish the original bonding.
	2. Oxidation: Another factor contributing to irreversibility in solids is the quick oxidation of freshly created surfaces. When a solid is split, the newly exposed surfaces can react with oxygen or other environmental species almost immediately. This chemical reaction alters the surface properties, making it impossible to bring the surfaces back together in their original state. The oxidized layer changes the surface energy, preventing the reformation of the original bonds.

### 0.7.1 Example Work of Cohesion (Homework 2)

Consider the system containing water and air. What is the work of cohesion (per unit area) assosciated with going from picture 1 to picture 2. Assume the wall of the box does not interact with anything in the box. The surface tension is $72 \frac{\mathrm{mN}}{\mathrm{m}}$.

### 0.7.2 Air-Water interface

The air-water interface is a region where the properties of air and water meet and interact. This interface is characterized by a surface tension, which is a measure of the energy required to increase the surface area of the interface. Surface tension arises because molecules at the interface experience different forces than those in the bulk of the air or water.

**Surface Tension at the Air-Water Interface**
The surface tension at the air-water interface is given as:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-water }}=72 \frac{\mathrm{mJ}}{\mathrm{m}^2}
$$


This means that 72 millijoules ( mJ ) of energy are required to create 1 square meter ( $\mathrm{m}^2$ ) of the airwater interface. The units of surface tension can be understood as:

$$
\frac{\text { energy }}{(\text { length })^2}=\frac{\text { Force } \times \text { Length }}{(\text { length })^2}=\frac{\text { Force }}{\text { Length }} \equiv \text { surface tension }\left(\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}}\right)
$$


In simpler terms, surface tension is the force per unit length acting along the surface of the liquid, which tends to minimize the surface area.


**Pressure at the Interface**
In an air-water interface system where both air and water are at 1 atm (atmospheric pressure), the pressure perpendicular to the interface is also 1 atm . This pressure can be described in terms of force per unit area:
- $1 \mathrm{~atm} \approx 1 \mathrm{bar} \approx 10^5 \mathrm{~Pa}=10^5 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2\left(\right.$ since $\left.1 \mathrm{~Pa}=1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2\right)$.

So, the perpendicular pressure at the interface is $10^5 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2$, which is the same as 1 atm .

**Surface Tension and Parallel Pressure**
Next, we consider the parallel pressure at the interface, which is related to surface tension.
Surface tension can be thought of as a force acting along the interface, parallel to the surface. This force per unit length is directly related to the surface tension $\gamma$.

To analyze this, consider a small length scale at the interface, say 1 nanometer ( $1 \mathrm{~nm}=10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}$ ). The surface tension acting over this length can be calculated as:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-water }} \times \frac{1}{\text { Length }}=72 \frac{\mathrm{mN}}{\mathrm{m}} \times \frac{1}{1 \mathrm{~nm}}
$$


Converting units:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =72 \times \frac{10^{-3} \mathrm{~N}}{\mathrm{~m}} \times \frac{1}{10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =72 \times 10^6 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}=720 \mathrm{~atm}
\end{aligned}
$$


This result, 720 atm , represents the parallel pressure at the air-water interface on the nanometer scale, derived from the surface tension. This extremely high pressure reflects the intense force acting on the interface, even though on larger scales, the observable pressure remains 1 atm .

**Understanding the Result**
- High Parallel Pressure: The calculation shows that the surface tension results in a very high parallel pressure ( 720 atm ) at the interface when considered at a very small scale ( 1 nm ). This pressure is not the pressure we typically observe in the bulk air or water but rather an effective pressure that indicates how strongly the molecules at the interface are held together by surface tension.
- Surface Tension and Energy: Surface tension is a measure of the energy per unit area required to create or maintain the interface. The high parallel pressure derived from surface tension emphasizes the significant energy cost associated with maintaining a large surface area, which is why systems tend to minimize surface area-this minimizes the energy stored in the surface tension.

#### 0.7.2.1 Dragonfly Sitting on the Surface of Water: Surface Tension Explanation
Dragonflies, like many other insects, can sit on the surface of water due to the phenomenon of surface tension. Surface tension is the result of cohesive forces between liquid molecules, which creates a "skin" on the surface that resists external forces. Here's how it works in the case of a dragonfly:

**Surface Tension and Water**
- Cohesive Forces: Water molecules are attracted to each other due to hydrogen bonding, which creates a strong cohesive force at the surface. This cohesive force pulls the surface molecules together, forming a surface "film" that resists being broken.
- Surface Tension: The surface tension of water is strong enough to support the weight of small, light objects, like a dragonfly, without breaking the surface. The surface tension acts like an elastic membrane that can support the dragonfly, provided that the force it exerts on the water's surface does not exceed the surface tension.

When a dragonfly lands on the water, its legs distribute its weight over a relatively large area, minimizing the force exerted on any one point of the water's surface. Because the dragonfly's weight is small and spread out, the water's surface tension is sufficient to keep the insect from sinking.

**Effect of Adding Soap: Decreasing Surface Energy**
When soap or a detergent is added to water, it decreases the surface tension of the water. This occurs because soap molecules have both hydrophobic (water-repelling) and hydrophilic (water-attracting) parts. When soap molecules are added to water:
- Disruption of Hydrogen Bonds: The hydrophobic tails of the soap molecules interfere with the hydrogen bonds between water molecules at the surface, weakening the cohesive forces that create surface tension.
- Lower Surface Tension: As a result, the surface tension decreases, making the water less able to support small objects on its surface. The surface energy (or the energy required to maintain the surface) is reduced, which means the water's surface becomes more easily deformable and less capable of sustaining the weight of objects like a dragonfly.
