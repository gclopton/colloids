# 3 Supercooling

- What is supercooling? Supercooling refers to the process of cooling a liquid below its thermodynamic freezing point without it becoming solid. 
- In a supercooled state, the liquid remains in a metastable phase because the nucleation barrier prevents the formation of a solid phase, even though the thermodynamically stable phase at that temperature is a solid.
- Why does supercooling occur? Supercooling occurs because, below the freezing point, the liquid's molecules do not spontaneously arrange themselves into a solid crystalline structure due to the nucleation barrier. 
- As the temperature decreases further, the likelihood of spontaneous nucleation increases because thermal fluctuations become less capable of overcoming the barrier. 
- Supercooling is commonly observed in pure liquids, where the absence of impurities or nucleation sites makes it difficult for solid nuclei to form.


##### Questions


Here are multiple-choice questions based on the concept of supercooling:

### 1.1.2 Question 9: Definition of Supercooling
9. **What does the term "supercooling" refer to?**
   - A. The cooling of a solid below its melting point until it becomes liquid
   - B. The process of cooling a liquid below its freezing point without it solidifying
   - C. The cooling of a liquid above its boiling point without vaporizing
   - D. The transformation of a solid directly into vapor when cooled below freezing  

   **Answer:** B

### 1.1.3 Question 10: Metastable Phase in Supercooling
10. **In a supercooled state, why does a liquid remain in a metastable phase instead of forming a solid?**
    - A. Because of a lack of thermal energy in the system
    - B. Due to the nucleation barrier that prevents the formation of a solid phase
    - C. Because the liquid is too pure to solidify
    - D. Due to the increase in surface energy  

    **Answer:** B

### 1.1.4 Question 11: Reason for Supercooling
11. **Why does supercooling occur in liquids?**
    - A. The liquid's molecules quickly form a crystalline structure below the freezing point
    - B. The nucleation barrier prevents molecules from arranging into a solid structure below the freezing point
    - C. The surface energy of the liquid decreases rapidly below freezing
    - D. Impurities in the liquid prevent it from solidifying  

    **Answer:** B

### 1.1.5 Question 12: Temperature Effect on Spontaneous Nucleation
12. **How does decreasing temperature affect the likelihood of spontaneous nucleation in a supercooled liquid?**
    - A. It decreases the likelihood, making the liquid remain supercooled indefinitely
    - B. It increases the likelihood because thermal fluctuations become less capable of overcoming the nucleation barrier
    - C. It has no effect; nucleation likelihood depends only on impurities
    - D. It only affects the nucleation barrier in solids  

    **Answer:** B

### 1.1.6 Question 13: Supercooling and Purity
13. **Why is supercooling commonly observed in pure liquids?**
    - A. Because impurities increase the nucleation rate
    - B. Because the absence of impurities or nucleation sites makes it difficult for solid nuclei to form
    - C. Because pure liquids do not experience a nucleation barrier
    - D. Because impurities cause solidification immediately below the freezing point  

    **Answer:** B
