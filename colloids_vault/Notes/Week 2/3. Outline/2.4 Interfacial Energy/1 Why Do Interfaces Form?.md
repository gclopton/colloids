# 1 Why Do Interfaces Form?

## 1.1.1 Thermodynamic Perspective on Interface Stability

- **Why do interfaces form according to thermodynamics?** In thermodynamics, interfaces form because systems tend to minimize their free energy. 
- **What does the interface between two phases such as a liquid and vapor or solid and liquid represent?** The interface between two phases, such as liquid and vapor or solid and liquid, represents a region where the properties change from those characteristic of one phase to those of the other. 
- **The stability of an interface arises because it represents a compromise between two competing effects. List these two effects.**
	- Minimization of Bulk Free Energy
	- Cost of Interface Formation (Surface Energy)
	- _Minimization of Bulk Free Energy:_ **How does a system tend to minimize its bulk free energy?** The system tends to minimize its bulk free energy by separating into distinct phases. 
		- _Example for oil and water:_ **How does a mixture of oil and water reduce its overall energy?** For example, in a mixture of oil and water, the system reduces its overall energy by minimizing the overlap between oil and water molecules, leading to phase separation.
	- _Cost of Interface Formation (Surface Energy):_ **Why does creating an interface cost energy?** Creating an interface costs energy because the molecules at the interface have fewer neighboring molecules of the same type, leading to higher energy states. 
		- **What is surface energy a measure of?** This surface energy is a measure of the energetic cost of having an interface
		- **Why is surface energy typically greater than the bulk?** it is typically greater than the bulk energy because the molecules at the surface are not as fully bonded as those in the bulk.
	- **What is the stability of an interface determined by?** The stability of an interface is determined by 
		- 1. the balance between the reduction in bulk free energy and 
		- 2. the increase in surface energy. 
	- **Considering bulk energy and surface energy, under what condition is an interface stable?** If the gain in bulk free energy from phase separation is greater than the cost of creating an interface ($\Delta E_b > E_s$) , the interface will be stable. Otherwise, the system may try to minimize the interfacial area, as seen in phenomena like droplet coalescence.


- **Why is the energy associated with the surface of a material (surface energy) is generally higher than the energy of the bulk material?** This difference arises because atoms or molecules at the surface experience different bonding environments than those in the bulk. In the bulk, each atom is surrounded by other atoms, leading to a stable, lower-energy configuration. At the surface, however, atoms have fewer neighbors, resulting in unbalanced forces and higher energy. 
- **Why do droplets of liquid tend to coalesce over time?** When small droplets combine to form a larger droplet, the total surface area decreases, thereby reducing the system's overall surface energy. The tendency to minimize surface energy is a driving force for the coalescence of droplets.

2. **Helmholtz Free Energy $(F)$ :** Defined as $F=U-T S$, where $U$ is the internal energy, $T$ is the temperature, and $S$ is the entropy of the system. Helmholtz free energy is used for processes occurring at constant volume and temperature.

Free energy represents the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system, excluding work done by pressure and volume changes. It is a key concept in determining the spontaneity of chemical reactions and phase transitions.

#### 1.1.3.2 Why Do Small Droplets Combine to Form Larger Droplets?
Small droplets combine to form larger droplets because this process minimizes the system's surface energy. For a fixed volume, the surface energy is directly proportional to the surface area of the droplet. Larger droplets have a smaller surface area relative to their volume compared to smaller droplets, which means they have lower surface energy for the same volume.


Volume to Surface Area Ratio for a Sphere
#### 1.1.3.3 Why do droplets tend to form spherical shapes? Show that a sphere is more energetically favorable that a cube in terms of surface energy.

Why do larger droplets have a lower surface energy per unit volume compared to smaller droplets?




**Surface area ratio of a sphere:**
The relationship between volume and surface area for a sphere is fundamental in understanding why droplets coalesce. For a sphere with radius $r$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{\text {sphere }} & =\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \\
A_{\text {sphere }} & =4 \pi r^2
\end{aligned}
$$


The ratio of volume to surface area for a sphere is:

$$
\frac{V}{A}=\frac{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{4 \pi r^2}=\frac{r}{3}
$$


This shows that as the radius $r$ increases, the volume-to-surface-area ratio increases, meaning that larger spheres (droplets) have a smaller surface area relative to their volume.

This ratio $\frac{V}{A}$ increases as the radius $r$ increases, indicating that larger spheres have a smaller surface area relative to their volume. This is why larger droplets have lower surface energy per unit volume compared to smaller droplets.


**Comparison with a Cube**

For comparison, consider a cube with side length $a$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
V_{\text {cube }}=a^3 \\
A_{\text {cube }}=6 a^2
\end{gathered}
$$


The ratio of volume to surface area for a cube is:

$$
\frac{V}{A}=\frac{a^3}{6 a^2}=\frac{a}{6}
$$


While the cube has a different geometry than the sphere, the same principle applies: as the characteristic length (side length $a$ for the cube or radius $r$ for the sphere) increases, the volumeto-surface-area ratio increases, which in turn reduces the surface energy.


**Takeaway:**
Comparing the surface area ratios:
- For a sphere: $\frac{V}{A}=\frac{r}{3}$
- For a cube: $\frac{V}{A}=\frac{a}{6}$

If we consider a sphere and a cube with the same characteristic length (i.e., $r=a$ ), the sphere has a higher volume-to-surface-area ratio:

$$
\frac{V_{\text {sphere }}}{A_{\text {sphere }}}=\frac{r}{3}, \quad \frac{V_{\text {cube }}}{A_{\text {cube }}}=\frac{a}{6}=\frac{r}{6}
$$


This comparison shows that for the same characteristic length, a sphere has a lower surface area relative to its volume than a cube. As a result, the sphere is energetically more favorable in terms of surface energy because it has less surface area to maintain, which is why droplets tend to form spherical shapes to minimize surface tension.

##### [mc] Calculate the surface area to volume ratio for a sphere with radius $r = 6$.
- [ ] 1.5 cm
- [x] 2 cm
- [ ] 3 cm
- [ ] 4 cm
[feedback]
1. Derivation:
   $$
   \frac{V}{A} = \frac{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{4 \pi r^2} = \frac{r}{3}
   $$
2. Calculation: For $r = 6 \, \text{cm}$:
   $$
   \frac{V}{A} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \, \text{cm}
   $$

##### [mc] The volume-to-surface area ratio increases for both the cube and the sphere as the side length $a$ for the cube or radius $r$ for the sphere increases. How does this increase in the volume-to-surface-area ratio for both shapes affect surface energy?
- [x] It decreases surface energy per unit volume as the characteristic length increases
- [ ] It increases surface energy per unit volume as the characteristic length increases

- [ ] The sphere has a higher surface area relative to its volume than the cube, which lowers surface energy.
- [x] The sphere has a lower surface area relative to its volume than the cube, which minimizes surface energy.
- [ ] The sphere and cube have the same surface area relative to their volume, so shape does not affect surface energy.
