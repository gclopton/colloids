# 4 Critical Radius ($r_c$)


- Critical radius $\left(r_c\right)$ is the minimum radius of a nucleus (such as a crystal or droplet) at which it becomes thermodynamically stable and can continue to grow. 
- If a nucleus is smaller than the critical radius, it will tend to dissolve or shrink because the surface energy cost is too high relative to the bulk free energy gain. 
- Conversely, if the nucleus reaches or exceeds the critical radius, it becomes energetically favorable for it to grow, leading to the formation of the new phase.


The critical radius is derived from the balance between the decrease in bulk free energy and the increase in surface energy:

$$
\Delta G_{\text {total }}=\text { Surface Energy }+ \text { Bulk Free Energy }
$$


The critical radius $r_c$ is found by setting the derivative of the total free energy with respect to the radius equal to zero (i.e., finding the maximum of the nucleation barrier). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \gamma}{\Delta G_v}
$$

where:
- $\gamma$ is the surface tension or surface energy per unit area,
- $\Delta G_v$ is the difference in bulk free energy per unit volume between the two phases.

The critical radius $r_c$ determines the size at which a nucleus can overcome the nucleation barrier and lead to the growth of a new phase, such as solidification in supercooled liquids or droplet formation in supersaturated vapors.


##### Questions

Here are multiple-choice questions based on the concept of the critical radius:

### Question 14: Definition of Critical Radius
14. **What is the "critical radius" $r_c$ in the context of phase transitions?**
   - A. The largest radius at which a nucleus will remain unstable
   - B. The minimum radius at which a nucleus becomes thermodynamically stable and can grow
   - C. The radius at which a nucleus dissolves back into the parent phase
   - D. The radius at which a nucleus becomes a supercooled liquid  

   **Answer:** B

### Question 15: Behavior of Nuclei Below the Critical Radius
15. **What happens to a nucleus that is smaller than the critical radius?**
    - A. It grows rapidly due to low surface energy costs
    - B. It remains unchanged until more molecules are added
    - C. It tends to dissolve or shrink because the surface energy cost is too high
    - D. It becomes energetically stable  

    **Answer:** C

### Question 16: Growth of Nucleus at or Above Critical Radius
16. **Why does a nucleus tend to grow if it reaches or exceeds the critical radius?**
    - A. It becomes energetically favorable as the bulk free energy gain outweighs the surface energy cost
    - B. It loses thermal energy, making growth more likely
    - C. It loses its surface energy entirely
    - D. It absorbs energy from the surrounding phase  

    **Answer:** A


Question 17: Role of Critical Radius in Nucleation
17. What role does the critical radius $r_c$ play in nucleation processes?
- A. It indicates the size at which a nucleus becomes unstable and shrinks
- B. It determines the size at which a nucleus can overcome the nucleation barrier and grow
- C. It is the largest radius that a nucleus can achieve before dissolving
- D. It only applies to superheated liquids and not supercooled liquids

Answer: B
Question 18: Applications of Critical Radius in Phase Transitions
18. In which of the following situations does the concept of critical radius $r_c$ apply?
- A. Solidification in supercooled liquids
- B. Droplet formation in supersaturated vapors
- C. Crystal formation in a supersaturated solution
- D. All of the above

Answer: D

Question 19: A supercooled liquid is undergoing nucleation to form a solid phase. The surface tension between the liquid and the solid phase is $0.15 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^2$. The bulk free energy difference between the liquid and solid phases at the given temperature is $2.5 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^3$. Calculate the critical radius $r_c$ of the nucleus at which it becomes thermodynamically stable and can grow.

The student should recall that the critical radius is given by:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \gamma}{\Delta G_v}
$$


Plugging in the values:

$$
r_c=\frac{2 \times 0.15}{2.5 \times 10^6}=\frac{0.3}{2.5 \times 10^6}=1.2 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}
$$


Thus, the critical radius $r_c$ is $1.2 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}$ or 120 nm .
