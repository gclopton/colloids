# 7 Work of Cohesion and Work of Adhesion

- When you have a material composed of two different substances bonded together, the boundary between them is called an interface. 
- This interface is a region where the properties of one material transition to the properties of the other. 
- The interface's characteristics, such as its energy, determine how easily the two materials can be separated or bonded.

- **Work of Adhesion:** When two different materials are bonded together, the energy required to split them apart to form two separate surfaces is known as the work of adhesion. 
	- This process involves breaking the bonds at the interface and creating new surfaces for each material. 
	- The work of adhesion is a measure of the strength of the interaction between the two different materials at the interface.
- **Work of Cohesion:** When a material is made of the same substance throughout, the energy required to split it apart is known as the work of cohesion. 
	- In this case, the same material bonds need to be broken on either side of the interface. 
	- The work of cohesion is related to the intrinsic bonding strength within the material itself.


Surface Energy $(\gamma)$
- Surface energy is a critical concept in understanding splitting surfaces. It represents the amount of energy required to create a unit area of surface. 
- Mathematically, surface energy is defined as:

$$
\gamma=\frac{\text { Energy required to create a surface }}{\text { Area of the surface created }}
$$

- Units: Surface energy is typically measured in energy per unit area (e.g., joules per square meter, $J / m^2$ ).
- When a material is split, new surfaces are created, and the energy associated with these surfaces is proportional to their surface energy.
- For two surfaces of the same material:

$$
W_{\|}=2 \cdot \gamma_s
$$
- Here, $W_{\|}$is the work required to split the material into two surfaces, and $\gamma_s$ is the surface energy of the material.



**Reversibility in Liquids vs. Solids**
- Liquids: In most liquids, the process of splitting and rejoining surfaces is reversible. 
	- This reversibility occurs because liquid molecules are not as rigidly bonded as those in solids, allowing them to flow and reattach with relative ease. 
	- The molecular mobility in liquids enables them to reform bonds and minimize the surface energy, effectively "healing" the split surfaces.
- Solids: In contrast, the process is typically irreversible in solids. This irreversibility arises from two main factors:
	1. Bond Strength: In solids, atoms or molecules are held together by strong, rigid bonds. When a solid is split, these bonds are broken, and re-forming them exactly as they were is extremely difficult. Unlike liquids, where molecules can easily move and reconfigure, the fixed positions of atoms in a solid make it challenging to reestablish the original bonding.
	2. Oxidation: Another factor contributing to irreversibility in solids is the quick oxidation of freshly created surfaces. When a solid is split, the newly exposed surfaces can react with oxygen or other environmental species almost immediately. This chemical reaction alters the surface properties, making it impossible to bring the surfaces back together in their original state. The oxidized layer changes the surface energy, preventing the reformation of the original bonds.

### 0.7.1 Example Work of Cohesion (Homework 2)

Consider the system containing water and air. What is the work of cohesion (per unit area) assosciated with going from picture 1 to picture 2. Assume the wall of the box does not interact with anything in the box. The surface tension is $72 \frac{\mathrm{mN}}{\mathrm{m}}$.

### 0.7.2 Air-Water interface

The air-water interface is a region where the properties of air and water meet and interact. This interface is characterized by a surface tension, which is a measure of the energy required to increase the surface area of the interface. Surface tension arises because molecules at the interface experience different forces than those in the bulk of the air or water.

**Surface Tension at the Air-Water Interface**
The surface tension at the air-water interface is given as:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-water }}=72 \frac{\mathrm{mJ}}{\mathrm{m}^2}
$$


This means that 72 millijoules ( mJ ) of energy are required to create 1 square meter ( $\mathrm{m}^2$ ) of the airwater interface. The units of surface tension can be understood as:

$$
\frac{\text { energy }}{(\text { length })^2}=\frac{\text { Force } \times \text { Length }}{(\text { length })^2}=\frac{\text { Force }}{\text { Length }} \equiv \text { surface tension }\left(\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}}\right)
$$


In simpler terms, surface tension is the force per unit length acting along the surface of the liquid, which tends to minimize the surface area.


**Pressure at the Interface**
In an air-water interface system where both air and water are at 1 atm (atmospheric pressure), the pressure perpendicular to the interface is also 1 atm . This pressure can be described in terms of force per unit area:
- $1 \mathrm{~atm} \approx 1 \mathrm{bar} \approx 10^5 \mathrm{~Pa}=10^5 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2\left(\right.$ since $\left.1 \mathrm{~Pa}=1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2\right)$.

So, the perpendicular pressure at the interface is $10^5 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2$, which is the same as 1 atm .

**Surface Tension and Parallel Pressure**
Next, we consider the parallel pressure at the interface, which is related to surface tension.
Surface tension can be thought of as a force acting along the interface, parallel to the surface. This force per unit length is directly related to the surface tension $\gamma$.

To analyze this, consider a small length scale at the interface, say 1 nanometer ( $1 \mathrm{~nm}=10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}$ ). The surface tension acting over this length can be calculated as:

$$
\gamma_{\text {air-water }} \times \frac{1}{\text { Length }}=72 \frac{\mathrm{mN}}{\mathrm{m}} \times \frac{1}{1 \mathrm{~nm}}
$$


Converting units:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =72 \times \frac{10^{-3} \mathrm{~N}}{\mathrm{~m}} \times \frac{1}{10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =72 \times 10^6 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}=720 \mathrm{~atm}
\end{aligned}
$$


This result, 720 atm , represents the parallel pressure at the air-water interface on the nanometer scale, derived from the surface tension. This extremely high pressure reflects the intense force acting on the interface, even though on larger scales, the observable pressure remains 1 atm .

**Understanding the Result**
- High Parallel Pressure: The calculation shows that the surface tension results in a very high parallel pressure ( 720 atm ) at the interface when considered at a very small scale ( 1 nm ). This pressure is not the pressure we typically observe in the bulk air or water but rather an effective pressure that indicates how strongly the molecules at the interface are held together by surface tension.
- Surface Tension and Energy: Surface tension is a measure of the energy per unit area required to create or maintain the interface. The high parallel pressure derived from surface tension emphasizes the significant energy cost associated with maintaining a large surface area, which is why systems tend to minimize surface area-this minimizes the energy stored in the surface tension.

#### 0.7.2.1 Dragonfly Sitting on the Surface of Water: Surface Tension Explanation
Dragonflies, like many other insects, can sit on the surface of water due to the phenomenon of surface tension. Surface tension is the result of cohesive forces between liquid molecules, which creates a "skin" on the surface that resists external forces. Here's how it works in the case of a dragonfly:

**Surface Tension and Water**
- Cohesive Forces: Water molecules are attracted to each other due to hydrogen bonding, which creates a strong cohesive force at the surface. This cohesive force pulls the surface molecules together, forming a surface "film" that resists being broken.
- Surface Tension: The surface tension of water is strong enough to support the weight of small, light objects, like a dragonfly, without breaking the surface. The surface tension acts like an elastic membrane that can support the dragonfly, provided that the force it exerts on the water's surface does not exceed the surface tension.

When a dragonfly lands on the water, its legs distribute its weight over a relatively large area, minimizing the force exerted on any one point of the water's surface. Because the dragonfly's weight is small and spread out, the water's surface tension is sufficient to keep the insect from sinking.

**Effect of Adding Soap: Decreasing Surface Energy**
When soap or a detergent is added to water, it decreases the surface tension of the water. This occurs because soap molecules have both hydrophobic (water-repelling) and hydrophilic (water-attracting) parts. When soap molecules are added to water:
- Disruption of Hydrogen Bonds: The hydrophobic tails of the soap molecules interfere with the hydrogen bonds between water molecules at the surface, weakening the cohesive forces that create surface tension.
- Lower Surface Tension: As a result, the surface tension decreases, making the water less able to support small objects on its surface. The surface energy (or the energy required to maintain the surface) is reduced, which means the water's surface becomes more easily deformable and less capable of sustaining the weight of objects like a dragonfly.
