# 2.5 Surface Composition

Surface composition often differs from the bulk composition of a material due to the unique energetic and structural conditions present at the surface. Unlike the bulk, where atoms or molecules are fully surrounded by neighbors, atoms or molecules at the surface experience different bonding environments and have unsatisfied bonds. This difference can lead to a variety of phenomena where certain species (atoms, molecules, or ions) preferentially migrate to or concentrate at the surface.

Why Surface Composition Differs from Bulk
- Energetic Considerations: Atoms or molecules at the surface have higher energy compared to those in the bulk because they have fewer neighboring atoms or molecules to bond with. This creates a driving force for the system to lower its overall energy by altering the surface composition.
- Surface Segregation: Certain species, particularly those that can lower the surface energy, tend to segregate to the surface. This process reduces the overall free energy of the system, making it energetically favorable.

Examples of Surface Segregation
1. Solutes in Alloys:
- In metallic alloys, different elements have different surface energies. Solute atoms with lower surface energy may preferentially migrate to the surface to reduce the overall surface energy. For example, in a copper-nickel alloy, nickel atoms might migrate to the surface if they lower the surface energy compared to copper.
2. Foreign Species:
- Foreign species, such as adsorbed gases or impurities, often segregate to the surface. For example, oxygen might adsorb onto the surface of a metal to form an oxide layer, significantly altering the surface composition compared to the bulk metal.

Segregation from High-Energy to Low-Energy Surfaces
Typically, species will segregate from high-energy surfaces to lower-energy surfaces. This process is often spontaneous and driven by the system's tendency to minimize its free energy:
- High-Energy Surface: A surface with unsatisfied bonds or high surface tension has higher free energy. This can occur in pure materials where the surface atoms are not fully bonded, leading to high surface energy.
- Lowering Surface Energy: When a foreign species adsorbs onto the high-energy surface, it can satisfy some of the unsatisfied bonds, effectively lowering the surface energy. This process is spontaneous because it reduces the system's overall free energy.

For example, in a system where a high-energy surface is exposed to an environment containing oxygen, the oxygen molecules may adsorb onto the surface, forming an oxide layer. This layer lowers the surface energy and stabilizes the system, making it less reactive and more thermodynamically stable.

Practical Implications
- Catalysis: In catalytic processes, the surface composition is critical because the activity of the catalyst depends on the surface atoms or molecules. Segregation of active species to the surface can enhance the catalytic activity.
- Corrosion Resistance: Surface segregation of protective elements (like chromium in stainless steel) can form a passive oxide layer that protects the underlying material from corrosion.
- Surface Treatments: Techniques like surface coating or doping are used to modify the surface composition intentionally to achieve desired properties, such as improved adhesion, reduced friction, or enhanced durability.



### Example of Surface Composition: Silicon Wafer

A silicon wafer, commonly used in the semiconductor industry, provides a clear example of how surface composition can involve multiple layers of different species, each contributing to the overall properties of the wafer's surface. The surface of a silicon wafer is a dynamic environment where various chemical interactions and processes take place, leading to a complex surface composition. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. Initial Surface Composition: Silicon Atoms
- A freshly prepared silicon wafer has a surface composed primarily of silicon atoms. These surface silicon atoms have unsatisfied bonds (dangling bonds) because they are not fully coordinated like the atoms in the bulk of the silicon wafer. This high-energy state makes the surface highly reactive.
2. Oxidation: Formation of Silicon Oxide Layer
- When exposed to air, the silicon surface rapidly reacts with oxygen, leading to the formation of a thin layer of silicon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_2\right)$. This process is known as oxidation. The silicon oxide layer is more stable and has a lower surface energy than the bare silicon surface.

$$
\mathrm{Si}+\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{SiO}_2
$$

- The oxide layer is typically a few nanometers thick and acts as a protective barrier, preventing further oxidation of the silicon below it. This oxide layer is essential in many semiconductor processes, where it serves as an insulating layer.
3. Hydroxyl Groups: Adsorption of Water
- The surface of the silicon oxide layer is hydrophilic due to the presence of hydroxyl $(\mathrm{OH})$ groups formed by the reaction of water molecules from the air with the oxide surface.

$$
\mathrm{SiO}_2+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}
$$

- These OH groups make the surface attractive to water molecules, which can adsorb onto the surface from the surrounding air. This creates a thin layer of adsorbed water on top of the silicon oxide layer, further modifying the surface composition.

4. Organic Contamination: Adsorption of Organic Molecules
- Over time, organic molecules present in the air, such as hydrocarbons, can adsorb onto the water layer or directly onto the silicon oxide surface. These organic contaminants form a thin organic layer on the wafer's surface.
- Organic contamination can occur due to various sources, including airborne particulates, handling of the wafer, and exposure to ambient air. This layer can interfere with subsequent processing steps, such as lithography, where a clean surface is critical for patterning.
5. Final Layer: Air (Nitrogen and Oxygen)
- The outermost layer interacting with the silicon wafer surface is the surrounding air, composed primarily of nitrogen $\left(\mathrm{N}_2\right)$ and oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_2\right)$. This layer does not chemically bond with the wafer but can still influence the surface chemistry, especially in the presence of moisture and other reactive gases.


#### Cleaning the Silicon Wafer: Removing Surface Contaminants
To prepare a silicon wafer for semiconductor manufacturing, it is crucial to clean the surface thoroughly to remove any contaminants, including organic molecules, adsorbed water, and oxide layers (if needed). Two common cleaning methods are:
1. Oxygen Plasma Cleaning
- Oxygen plasma cleaning involves exposing the silicon wafer to a plasma environment rich in oxygen ions and radicals. The high-energy oxygen species react with organic contaminants on the surface, breaking them down into volatile products like $\mathrm{CO}_2$ and $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$, which are then removed by vacuum.

Organic Contaminants $+\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_2+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$
- This method effectively removes organic layers and can also enhance the hydrophilicity of the silicon oxide surface by generating more hydroxyl groups.
2. Nanostrip/Piranha Solution Cleaning
- Piranha Solution (a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) is a powerful oxidizing agent used to clean silicon wafers. It removes organic contaminants and strips away any organic residues by oxidizing them into water-soluble byproducts.

$$
\mathrm{C}_x \mathrm{H}_y+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_2+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4
$$

- Nanostrip is a commercial formulation similar to Piranha solution but optimized for wafer cleaning. It can also help remove thin oxide layers if needed, exposing a fresh silicon surface for subsequent processing.



## Monolayer Coverage and Surfactants

Surfactants: Structure and Function
Surfactants are molecules that have both hydrophilic (water-attracting) and hydrophobic (waterrepelling) parts, making them amphiphilic. A typical surfactant molecule, such as stearic acid, consists of:
- Hydrophilic Head: The polar or ionic part of the molecule that is attracted to water. In stearic acid, this is the carboxyl group $(-\mathrm{COOH})$.
- Hydrophobic Tail: The nonpolar part of the molecule that repels water and is usually composed of long hydrocarbon chains. In stearic acid, this is the 18-carbon alkyl chain ($\mathrm{C}_7 \mathrm{H}_{35}$ ).

Surfactants in an Air-Water Interface
When surfactants are introduced into an air-water system, they tend to arrange themselves at the interface between the air and water due to their amphiphilic nature. This arrangement minimizes the system's free energy:
- Hydrophobic Tail in Air: The hydrophobic tails of the surfactant molecules extend away from the water and point towards the air. This minimizes their exposure to water, which they repel.
- Hydrophilic Head in Water: The hydrophilic heads remain immersed in the water, where they can interact favorably with water molecules through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions.

This configuration forms what is known as a monolayer on the water surface, where each surfactant molecule occupies a specific area on the surface, with the tails pointing up into the air and the heads down into the water.

Formation of a Monolayer
The formation of a monolayer is the initial stage of surfactant adsorption at the air-water interface. As the concentration of the surfactant in the water increases, more molecules will migrate to the surface until the entire surface is covered with a monolayer.
- Monolayer Coverage: A monolayer is formed when the surface is covered by a single layer of surfactant molecules, with no space left for additional molecules to fit in without disrupting the existing arrangement. At this point, the surface is saturated with surfactant, and no more molecules can adsorb to the surface.

Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)
After the monolayer is formed, if the concentration of surfactant in the bulk water is increased further, the additional surfactant molecules will no longer fit at the air-water interface. Instead, they start to aggregate in the bulk water, forming micelles.
- Micelles: These are spherical or cylindrical aggregates where the hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the center, away from the water, while the hydrophilic heads face outward, interacting with the water.
- Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC): The CMC is the specific concentration of surfactant at which micelles begin to form in the solution. Below the CMC, all surfactant molecules are primarily adsorbed at the interface, but above the CMC, excess molecules form micelles.


Calculating the Amount of Surfactant for Monolayer Formation
To form a monolayer, it is important to know the right amount of surfactant needed to cover the surface area of the water. This requires:
1. Surface Area of the Water: Determine the total surface area that needs to be covered by the surfactant.
2. Area Per Molecule: Estimate the area that each surfactant molecule occupies on the surface. This can be determined experimentally or from literature data. For example, stearic acid typically occupies about $0.2 \mathrm{~nm}^2$ per molecule on a water surface.
3. Number of Molecules Required: Calculate the number of molecules needed to cover the surface:

$$
\text { Number of molecules }=\frac{\text { Surface area }}{\text { Area per molecule }}
$$

4. Mole Calculation: Convert the number of molecules to moles using Avogadro's number:

$$
\text { Moles of surfactant }=\frac{\text { Number of molecules }}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \text { molecules } / \mathrm{mol}}
$$

5. Mass of Surfactant: Finally, calculate the mass of the surfactant required using its molecular weight.

$$
\text { Mass of surfactant }=\text { Moles of surfactant } \times \text { Molecular weight }
$$


By carefully calculating the amount of surfactant needed, you can ensure that a monolayer forms at the air-water interface, providing effective coverage without leading to excess surfactant that could form micelles prematurely.

##### Estimate the mass of surfactant needed to cover a given area of an interface with a monolayer of molecules.


Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Understanding the Formula:

$$
\left.\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { area }}=\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }} \times \text { (interfacial thickness or interfacial height of molecule }\right)
$$


This equation is used to determine the mass per unit area of a substance required to cover an interface. The key components are:
- Mass per volume ( $\left(\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }}\right)$ represents the density of the substance.
- Interfacial thickness or height of molecule is the dimension of the molecule perpendicular to the surface, which represents how thick the monolayer is.
2. Given Values:
- Density of water: $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^3$
- Interfacial thickness: 1 nm (which is the height of the molecule in this case)
3. Conversion of Units:
- $1 \mathrm{~nm}=10^{-7} \mathrm{~cm}$
- $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^3=10^{-3} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{nm}^3$
  
  
  4. Calculation:

To find the mass per unit area ( $\left.\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { area }}\right)$, we use the given formula:

$$
\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { area }}=\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~cm}^3}\right) \times(1 \mathrm{~nm})
$$


Substitute the conversion factor:

$$
\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { area }}=\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~cm}^3}\right) \times\left(10^{-7} \mathrm{~cm}\right)
$$


Simplifying the expression:

$$
\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { area }}=10^{-7} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^2
$$


Convert grams to micrograms $\left(1 \mathrm{~g}=10^6 \mu \mathrm{g}\right)$ :

$$
\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { area }}=10^{-7} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^2 \times 10^6 \frac{\mu \mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{g}}=0.1 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^2
$$

5. Conclusion:

The take-home message is that you only need $0.1 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of the substance to cover $1 \mathrm{~cm}^2$ of the interface with a monolayer. This result is consistent with the calculated values.






### Example 2: Lipid Bilayers

Lipid bilayers are fundamental structures in biological membranes, primarily composed of phospholipids. Understanding why lipids self-assemble into bilayers and the packing density of these lipids is crucial for grasping how membranes function.

Phospholipid Structure and Self-Assembly
Phospholipids are amphiphilic molecules consisting of:
- Hydrophilic Head: The polar, water-attracting part that interacts with the aqueous environment.
- Hydrophobic Tail: The nonpolar, water-repelling part that avoids contact with water.

Dimensions of a Phospholipid:
- Length: The overall length of a phospholipid molecule is approximately 2 nm .
- Tail-to-Tail Distance: In a bilayer, the tails of phospholipids from two opposite layers face each other, resulting in a tail-to-tail distance of about 1 nm .

Why Do Lipids Self-Assemble into Bilayers?
Phospholipids spontaneously self-assemble into bilayers due to their amphiphilic nature:
- Minimization of Free Energy: The hydrophobic tails avoid water by aggregating together, while the hydrophilic heads remain exposed to the aqueous environment. This arrangement minimizes the system's free energy, making the bilayer structure thermodynamically stable.
- Planar Arrangement of Tails: The hydrophobic tails prefer to be in planes to maximize van der Waals interactions and minimize their exposure to water. This planar packing is energetically favorable and leads to the formation of bilayers.

Different Structural Phases of Lipid Bilayers
Lipid bilayers can exist in various ordered states depending on temperature and the types of lipids present:
- Liquid-Crystalline Structure: This is a semi-ordered phase where the lipids have some fluidity but maintain a certain degree of order. The lipids can move laterally within the plane of the membrane but are still relatively organized.
- Gel-Like Structure: In this phase, the lipids are tightly packed, and the membrane has minimal fluidity. The tails are closely packed together, leading to a more rigid structure.
- Liquid-Disordered Structure: In this phase, the lipids are more loosely packed, and the membrane is highly fluid. The lipid tails are less ordered, allowing more movement and flexibility.


Packing Density of Phospholipids
Packing Density refers to the number of phospholipids per unit area in the bilayer. Understanding the packing density is important for assessing how tightly the lipids are arranged in the membrane.
- Example Calculations:
- $200 \mathrm{~nm}^2$ Area: If there are 600,000 lipids in a $200 \mathrm{~nm}^2$ area, the packing density can be calculated as:

$$
\text { Packing Density }=\frac{600,000 \text { lipids }}{200 \mathrm{~nm}^2}=3000 \text { lipids } / \mathrm{nm}^2
$$

- $5 \mathrm{~nm}^2$ Area: For a smaller area of $5 \mathrm{~nm}^2$ with 40,000 lipids:

$$
\text { Packing Density }=\frac{40,000 \text { lipids }}{5 \mathrm{~nm}^2}=8000 \text { lipids } / \mathrm{nm}^2
$$


However, these values seem inconsistent with the typical lipid packing density, which is generally around 1.5 lipids per $\mathrm{nm}^2$. Let's reconsider:
- Typical Packing Density: Typically, lipid bilayers have a packing density of about 1.5 lipids per $\mathrm{nm}^2$. This means:

$$
\text { Packing Density } \approx 1.5 \text { lipids } / \mathrm{nm}^2
$$


Given this typical value, for a $1 \mathrm{~nm}^2$ area, you would expect roughly 1.5 lipids, indicating that the lipids are tightly packed but still allow some movement.
