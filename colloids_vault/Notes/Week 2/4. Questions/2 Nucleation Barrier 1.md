## 2 Nucleation Barrier

- **What is a Nucleation barrier?** Nucleation barrier refers to the energy barrier that must be overcome for a new phase to form from a parent phase during a phase transition
	- **Which of the following are examples?** such as (1) the formation of a crystal nucleus from a supersaturated solution or (2) a droplet from a vapor. 
	- **Why does the nucleation barrier arise?** The nucleation barrier arises due to the competition between the bulk free energy, which drives the phase transition, and the surface energy, which opposes it.
- **Bulk Free Energy Decrease:** When a new phase forms, the bulk free energy decreases, contributing to the thermodynamic favorability of the phase transition.
- **Surface Energy Increase:** However, creating a new interface between the phases increases the system's surface energy. This surface energy creates an energy barrier that the system must overcome for a stable nucleus to form and grow.

- The nucleation barrier is often depicted in terms of a free energy curve, 
	- **What does the maximum point correspond to?** where the maximum point corresponds to the critical nucleus size (the smallest stable nucleus), 
	- **What does the height of the peak represent?** and the height of this peak represents the nucleation barrier. 
	- Overcoming this barrier typically requires thermal fluctuations or external driving forces.
