# 1 The Interaction Potential U(r)

##### [sa] What types of interactions contribute to the van der Waals forces between two molecules?
[answ]
The interaction potential between two molecules include interactions due to; 1.) permanent dipoles, 2.) induced dipoles, and 3.) dispersion forces which are collectively known as van der Waals interactions.

##### [sa] What type of intermolecular force dominates when neither molecule has a permanent dipole?
[answ]
In cases where neither molecule has a permanent dipole, the interaction is dominated by London dispersion forces.

##### [sa] How do London dispersion forces originate?
[answ]
These forces arise from the instantaneous dipoles generated by fluctuations in electron distribution in each molecule, which in turn induce corresponding dipoles in neighboring molecules.

##### [sa] Two different nonpolar molecules $A$ and $B$ are separated by a distance $r=4.0 \AA$. Molecule $A$ has a polarizability $\alpha_A=1.5 \times 10^{-30} \sim \mathrm{~m}^3$ and an ionization energy $I_A=9.0 \times$ $10^{-19} \sim \mathrm{~J}$. Molecule $B$ has a polarizability $\alpha_B=2.0 \times 10^{-30} \sim \mathrm{~m}^3$ and an ionization energy $I_B=8.0 \times 10^{-19} \sim \mathrm{~J}$. Calculate the interaction potential $U(r)$ between molecules $A$ and $B$ at the separation distance $r=4.0 \AA$.
