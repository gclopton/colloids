 - [ ] $1 t o 5 \times 10^4$
 - [ ] 1 to $5 \times 10^1$
 - [ ] $1 t o 5 \times 10^3$

###### Which statement is true?
- [x] The surface energy of solids is usually greater than the surface tension of liquids.
- [ ] The surface energy of solids is usually less than the surface tension of liquids.
- [ ] The surface energy of solids is usually equal to the surface tension of liquids.
==Basically, what is being said here is the following: More energy is required to increase the surface area of a solid than is required to increase the surface area of a liquid.==



##### What is Entropy?
 - [ ] Measure of the number of possible macroscopic states that comply with the microscopic condition of the system.
 - [ ] Measure of the number of possible macroscopic states that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system.
 - [ ] Measure of the number of possible microscopic states that comply with the microscopic condition of the system.
 - [x] None of the above

- [x] more hydrophilic.
- [ ] more hydrophobic.



##### Given that you have about $1 \mathrm{ft}^2$ of average surface area contacting another average surface, how large is the actual area of contact?
 - [ ] less than $10^{-3} \mathrm{ft}^2$
 - [ ] more than $1 \mathrm{ft}^2$
 - [ ] less than $0.5 \mathrm{ft}^2$
 - [x] less than $10^{-2} f t^2$
 - [ ] None of the above



##### How long-ranged can the effect of an interface on glass transition in a thin polymer film be?
 - [ ] 100 s of $\mu \mathrm{m}$
 - [ ] $1 \mu \mathrm{m}$
 - [ ] 1 nm
